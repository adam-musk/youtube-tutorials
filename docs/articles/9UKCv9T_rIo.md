## 4. Initializing the Expo Project

Once your development environment is set up, you can initialize the Expo project structure.

1.  **Create a New Project Folder:**
    *   Right-click on your desktop or preferred location and create a new folder. Name it `meditation` or a similar descriptive name.
    *   Drag and drop this folder into Visual Studio Code to open it.

2.  **Open Integrated Terminal in VS Code:**
    *   In VS Code, open the integrated terminal (**Ctrl+`** or **Cmd+`**).

3.  **Run Expo CLI Command:**
    *   Refer to the latest Expo documentation ([docs.expo.dev](https://docs.expo.dev)) for the most up-to-date installation commands. At the time of this tutorial, the command was:
        ```bash
        npx create-expo-app simple-meditation
        ```
        This command uses `npx` (Node Package eXecute) to run the `create-expo-app` tool, which generates a boilerplate Expo React Native project named `simple-meditation`.

> **Expo CLI (Command Line Interface)**
> A command-line tool for working with Expo projects. It allows you to create, build, run, and deploy Expo applications. `npx create-expo-app` is a command within the Expo CLI to generate a new Expo project with a basic project structure.

> **Boilerplate**
>  A set of basic, reusable code and files that serve as a starting point for a new project. It saves developers from writing the same initial setup code repeatedly.

4.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    *   Once the project is created and dependencies are installed, change your current directory in the terminal to the newly created project folder:
        ```bash
        cd simple-meditation
        ```

5.  **Start the Expo Development Server:**
    *   Run the command to start the Expo development server:
        ```bash
        npx expo start --clear
        ```
        The `--clear` flag clears the cache, which can resolve some issues during development.

    *   This command will start the Expo development server and display a **QR code** in your terminal.

6.  **Run the App on Simulator/Emulator or Physical Device:**
    *   **iOS Simulator:** Press **`i`** in the terminal. This will open the iOS simulator and run your application. (Requires Xcode to be installed and configured).
    *   **Android Emulator:** Press **`a`** in the terminal. This will open the Android emulator and run your application. (Requires Android Studio to be installed and configured).
    *   **Physical Device (using Expo Go):**
        *   Open the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device.
        *   Scan the **QR code** displayed in your terminal using the Expo Go app. Your application will run on your physical device.
        *   **Web Browser:** Press **`w`** in the terminal to run the app in your web browser.

> **Simulator/Emulator**
> Software that imitates the hardware and software of a mobile device (like iOS or Android) on your computer. Simulators and emulators are used for testing mobile applications during development without needing a physical device.

> **QR Code (Quick Response Code)**
> A type of two-dimensional barcode that can be scanned by smartphones or QR code readers. In Expo, a QR code is used to quickly launch an application on a mobile device via the Expo Go app.

7.  **Troubleshooting Errors:**
    *   If you encounter errors during this process, copy the error message and search online resources like **Google**, **Stack Overflow**, or **ChatGPT**. These platforms often contain solutions and discussions for common development errors.

## 5. Project Structure and Initial Setup

After successfully initializing the Expo project, it's essential to understand the basic project structure and perform initial setup steps.

### 5.1. Project Directory Structure

The `create-expo-app` command generates a pre-defined project structure:

*   **`app/` directory:** This directory contains the source code for your application. Using Expo Router, it employs file-based routing.
    *   **`index.tsx` (or `index.jsx`):** This is the entry point for your application's home screen.
    *   **`_layout.tsx` (or `_layout.jsx`):**  Layout files define shared UI components and navigation structure for directories.
    *   **`tabs/` directory:** (Created later) Used for implementing tab navigation, grouping related screens.
    *   **`modal/` directory:** (Created later) Used for modal screens or components.
*   **`assets/` directory:** Contains static assets like images, fonts, and icons.
*   **`components/` directory:** (Created later)  Will house reusable React Native components.
*   **`constants/` directory:** (Created later)  Used for storing constant values, data, and configuration files.
*   **`hooks/` directory:** (Optional, for custom React Hooks).
*   **`scripts/` directory:** (Optional, for build or utility scripts).
*   **`app.json`:** Configuration file for your Expo app (name, icons, splash screen, etc.).
*   **`babel.config.js`:** Babel configuration file for JavaScript transpilation.
*   **`package.json`:**  Lists project dependencies, scripts, and other project metadata.
*   **`tailwind.config.js`:** (Created after installing NativeWind) Configuration file for Tailwind CSS using NativeWind.

> **File-Based Routing**
> A routing system where the structure of URLs is determined by the file system structure of the application's source code. Expo Router uses this approach, making navigation intuitive by mapping file paths to routes.

> **JSX (JavaScript XML)**
> A syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures within JavaScript code. It's commonly used in React to define UI components.

> **TSX (TypeScript XML)**
>  The TypeScript equivalent of JSX. It combines JSX syntax with TypeScript's static typing, offering type safety and improved code maintainability for React components.

### 5.2. Clearing Boilerplate Code and Initial Setup

1.  **Clean Up `app/index.tsx` (or `index.jsx`):**
    *   Open `app/index.tsx` (or `index.jsx`).
    *   Remove all existing boilerplate code within the file.
    *   Start with a basic functional component structure:

        ```tsx
        import React from 'react';
        import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

        export default function App() {
          return (
            <View style={styles.container}>
              <Text>Hello World</Text>
            </View>
          );
        }

        const styles = StyleSheet.create({
          container: {
            flex: 1,
            justifyContent: 'center',
            alignItems: 'center',
          },
        });
        ```

    *   **Hot Reloading:** Save the file (**Cmd+S** or **Ctrl+S**). Expo's **hot reloading** feature will automatically update the app in the simulator/emulator or on your device to reflect your changes without requiring a full refresh. You should see "Hello World" displayed.

> **Hot Reloading**
> A development feature that automatically updates the application in real-time whenever code changes are saved. It allows developers to see the effects of their code modifications instantly without manually refreshing the app.

2.  **Delete Unnecessary Boilerplate Files:**
    *   In the `app/` directory, delete the `_layout.tsx` and `tabs/` directories and their contents. These will be recreated and customized later in the tutorial.
    *   Delete any test files (`.test.js` or `.test.tsx`) if present, to start with a clean project structure.

3.  **Add Asset Files:**
    *   Copy the downloaded asset folders (images, fonts, audio, logo) into the `assets/` directory of your project, replacing the existing `assets` directory if prompted.

4.  **Create Constant Files:**
    *   Create a new directory named `constants/` in the root of your project.
    *   Inside `constants/`, create the following TypeScript files:
        *   `affirmation-images.typescript`
        *   `meditation-images.typescript`
        *   `meditation-data.typescript`
        *   `colors.typescript`
        *   `affirmations-gallery.typescript`
    *   Copy the code snippets for each of these files from the GitHub repository's `snippets` section and paste them into the respective files. These files define data structures for images, meditation data, affirmation categories, and color palettes used in the app.

5.  **Install NativeWind:**
    *   Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
    *   Run the command to install NativeWind, which allows using Tailwind CSS classes in React Native:
        ```bash
        npm install nativewind
        ```

6.  **Install Tailwind CSS as a Dev Dependency:**
    *   Run the command to install Tailwind CSS as a development dependency:
        ```bash
        npm install -D tailwindcss
        ```

7.  **Initialize Tailwind CSS Configuration:**
    *   Run the command to initialize the Tailwind CSS configuration file:
        ```bash
        npx tailwindcss init
        ```
        This creates a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project root.

8.  **Update `tailwind.config.js`:**
    *   Open `tailwind.config.js`.
    *   Replace the default content with the code snippet provided in the GitHub repository's `snippets` section for `tailwind.config.js`. This configuration specifies content sources, NativeWind usage, and custom font families.

9.  **Update `babel.config.js`:**
    *   Open `babel.config.js`.
    *   In the `plugins` array, add `'nativewind/babel'` as a plugin:

        ```javascript
        module.exports = function(api) {
          api.cache(true);
          return {
            presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
            plugins: ['nativewind/babel'], // Add this line
          };
        };
        ```

10. **Run Expo Start Again:**
    *   Restart the Expo development server to apply the NativeWind and Tailwind CSS configurations: `npx expo start --clear`.

11. **Apply NativeWind Styles (Example in `index.tsx`):**
    *   Open `app/index.tsx`.
    *   Replace the `StyleSheet` based styles with NativeWind class names. For example, modify the `View` component style like this:

        ```tsx
        <View className="flex-1 justify-center items-center">
          <Text>Hello World</Text>
        </View>
        ```
        Here, `className` is used to apply Tailwind CSS utility classes directly to the React Native component.

12. **Create Declaration File for NativeWind (Optional - to remove VS Code warnings):**
    *   Create a new file in the root of your project named `global.d.ts`.
    *   Add the following declaration to this file:

        ```typescript
        import 'nativewind/types';
        ```
        This declaration file helps VS Code recognize and properly handle the `className` prop for NativeWind, removing potential squiggly line warnings in the editor.

This comprehensive setup process lays the foundation for building the meditation app, equipping you with the necessary tools, project structure, and styling capabilities to proceed with development. The following sections will guide you through building the app's UI and functionality step-by-step.
