### 4. Render

If you are working on a **full-stack application** that requires **backend** support, Render is a platform to consider.

> **Full-stack Application:** A type of web application that involves both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development. It typically includes a database, server logic, and user interface.

> **Backend:** The server-side portion of a web application, responsible for data storage, processing, and application logic. It typically includes a server, database, and APIs that handle requests from the front-end.

Render allows you to deploy not only static sites but also **APIs** and **databases** with ease.

> **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. In web development, APIs often allow the front-end to request data from or send data to the backend server.

> **Database:** An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are used to store and manage data for applications, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation of information.

This makes it a versatile option for more complex web applications.

**Key Features of Render:**

*   **Full-Stack Deployment:** Supports deployment of static sites, backend APIs, and databases.
