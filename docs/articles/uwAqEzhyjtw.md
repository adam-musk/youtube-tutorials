## Introduction to the Command Line

For developers across all disciplines, familiarity with the command line is an invaluable asset. Whether you're managing front-end dependencies, accessing remote servers, or automating complex tasks, the command line offers a powerful and efficient way to interact with your computer.  This chapter serves as a comprehensive crash course, guiding you through the fundamental concepts and commands necessary to navigate your file system, manage files and folders, and leverage the command line for enhanced productivity. While this guide primarily uses a macOS environment for demonstrations, the principles and most commands are applicable across Windows and Linux operating systems. We will highlight key differences and provide guidance for users of each platform.

## Why Learn the Command Line?

While modern operating systems boast user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), the command line interface (CLI) offers distinct advantages that are crucial for developers. Here are some compelling reasons to invest in learning the command line:

*   **Greater Control:** The command line provides a direct, back-end access point to your operating system. It unlocks capabilities beyond the limitations of the GUI, allowing you to perform intricate operations and manage system configurations with precision. This granular control is especially important for tasks like managing file permissions and user access.

*   **Speed and Efficiency:**  Mastering command line navigation and commands can significantly accelerate your workflow. Tasks involving multiple files or directories, which might be tedious and time-consuming in a GUI, can be accomplished swiftly with single commands.  Furthermore, the ability to alias commands and keep your hands on the keyboard minimizes mouse usage, enhancing overall efficiency.

*   **Accessing Remote Servers:** For web developers and system administrators, accessing remote servers is a frequent requirement.  **SSH (Secure Shell)**, a protocol for secure remote login, is predominantly command-line based.  Understanding the command line is therefore essential for deploying websites, managing server infrastructure, and performing remote administration.

    > **SSH (Secure Shell):** A cryptographic network protocol that allows secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks. It provides a secure encrypted channel between two computers, typically used to remotely log in to a server.

*   **Command Line Tools:** A vast ecosystem of powerful development tools are designed to be used directly from the command line.  These tools often lack GUI equivalents and are indispensable for modern development workflows. Examples include:
    *   **npm (Node Package Manager):** Used for managing JavaScript packages and dependencies in front-end and back-end development.
    *   **Git:** A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
    *   **Pre-processors (e.g., Sass):** Tools that extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins, often compiled via the command line.
    *   **Task Runners and Bundlers (e.g., Webpack, Parcel):** Tools that automate development tasks like code minification, bundling, and asset optimization, typically configured and run through the command line.

    > **npm (Node Package Manager):** A package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment and is used to install, share, and manage project dependencies.

    > **Git:** A distributed version control system that tracks changes in files over time, allowing for collaboration, version rollback, and branching for feature development.

*   **Career Advancement:** Command line proficiency is a highly sought-after skill in the tech industry. Employers often expect developers to be comfortable navigating their system and utilizing command-line tools like `npm` and `git`.  Demonstrating command-line skills enhances your employability and opens doors to a wider range of development roles.

## Understanding Key Terminology: Terminal, Command Line, and Shell

The terms "command line," "terminal," and "shell" are often used interchangeably, especially in casual conversation. However, understanding their distinct meanings is beneficial for a clearer grasp of how the command line environment operates.

### The Terminal: Your Window to the Shell

Historically, a **terminal** was a physical hardware device consisting of a screen and keyboard, used to interact with mainframe computers. These devices were essentially endpoints for communication, terminating the wires from the central computer.

> **Terminal:** In its historical context, a physical device with a keyboard and display used for interacting with a computer. In modern computing, it refers to a software application that emulates the functionality of a hardware terminal.

Today, we use **terminal emulators**, software applications that replicate the functionality of these hardware terminals.  These emulators provide the interface where you type commands and view the output.  Examples include the default Terminal application on macOS, various terminal emulators on Linux, and options like Git Bash, Hyper, and Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows.

> **Terminal Emulator:** A software application that mimics the functions of a hardware terminal, providing a text-based interface for interacting with the operating system's shell.

### The Command Line: The Interface for Commands

The **command line** or **command prompt** refers to the text-based interface within the terminal where you input commands and receive responses from the system. It is the specific line where you type instructions that the computer will execute.  Windows often uses the term "command line" or "command prompt" (cmd) to describe its default terminal application.

> **Command Line (or Command Prompt):** The text-based interface within a terminal where users type commands to interact with the operating system. It is characterized by a prompt that indicates the system is ready to receive commands.

### The Shell: The Command Interpreter

The **shell** is the program that acts as an intermediary between you and the operating system's kernel. It reads the commands you type into the command line, interprets them, and instructs the operating system to perform the requested actions. Different shells can have varying features and command syntax.

> **Shell:** A command-line interpreter that provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system. It takes commands as input, interprets them, and executes programs or system calls.

**Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** is a widely used shell, historically the default on most Linux and Unix-based systems, including macOS (until recently).  **Zsh (Z Shell)** is another popular shell, now the default on macOS, offering enhanced features and customization.  While syntax differences exist between shells, most fundamental commands are consistent across Bash and Zsh.

> **Bash (Bourne Again Shell):** A popular and powerful command-line shell, widely used as the default shell on many Linux distributions and historically on macOS.

> **Zsh (Z Shell):** A Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a shell script command interpreter. It is known for its extensive customization options and features, and is now the default shell on macOS.

### Windows Command Line Environments

Microsoft's history with command-line interfaces began with **DOS (Disk Operating System)**, a command-line based OS.  Early versions of Windows ran on top of DOS.  While Windows evolved into a GUI-centric OS, it retained command-line capabilities.

Initially, Windows used `command.com` and later `cmd.exe` as its default command-line interpreters. These were relatively limited compared to Unix-based shells.  **PowerShell** emerged as a more advanced and object-oriented shell for Windows, offering greater power and flexibility, particularly for system administration.

> **PowerShell:** A powerful task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language, built on the .NET Framework.

However, the Windows command line environment traditionally differed significantly from Unix-based systems in terms of available commands and syntax.  Historically, even basic utilities like SSH were not natively available and required third-party tools like PuTTY.

To bridge this gap, several options exist for Windows users who prefer a Unix-like command-line experience:

*   **Git Bash:** A terminal emulator that comes bundled with Git for Windows, providing a Bash shell environment and many common Unix utilities on Windows.
*   **Hyper:** A cross-platform terminal emulator that can be configured to use various shells, including Bash on Windows.
*   **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** A compatibility layer that allows you to run a Linux environment directly within Windows, providing access to a full Linux shell and command-line tools.

> **Git Bash:** A shell environment for Windows that provides Git command-line tools and a Bash emulation, offering a Unix-like command-line experience on Windows.

> **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** A compatibility layer in Windows that allows users to run a GNU/Linux environment – including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications – directly on Windows, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

For this crash course, and for general cross-platform development, using **Git Bash** on Windows is highly recommended as it provides a compatible environment for most of the commands we will cover.  PowerShell is a valuable skill for Windows system administrators, but for general development tasks, a Unix-like shell is often more practical due to the prevalence of Unix-based tools and servers.

## Getting Started: Basic Command Line Operations

Now that we have a foundational understanding of the terminology and different environments, let's dive into practical command line usage.

### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

Efficient command line usage relies heavily on keyboard shortcuts. Here are some fundamental shortcuts that will significantly enhance your workflow:

*   **Up/Down Arrow Keys:**  Cycle through your command history. Pressing the **Up arrow** recalls the previously executed command, and subsequent presses move further back in history. The **Down arrow** navigates forward through the history. This is invaluable for re-running or modifying previous commands.

*   **Tab Key:**  Enables auto-completion.  When typing commands or file/directory names, pressing **Tab** attempts to complete the entry automatically. If there's a unique match, it will complete the name. If multiple matches exist, pressing **Tab** twice will display a list of possible completions.

*   **Ctrl + L:** Clears the terminal screen. This shortcut clears the current terminal display, providing a clean workspace without affecting command history or the current directory.  The `clear` command achieves the same result.

*   **Ctrl + C:** Cancels the current command. If you start typing a command but decide not to execute it, **Ctrl + C** will interrupt the command and return you to a new command prompt.

*   **Ctrl + R:** Initiates reverse search in command history. Pressing **Ctrl + R** opens a search prompt. As you type, it searches backwards through your command history and displays the most recent command matching your input.  Press **Ctrl + C** to exit search mode.

*   **Ctrl + D:** Closes the terminal window.  This shortcut terminates the current terminal session and closes the window.

### Getting Help: The `man` and `help` Commands

The command line provides built-in documentation to assist you in understanding and using commands.

*   **`man` command (Manual):**  Used to access the manual page for a specific command.  Type `man <command_name>` (e.g., `man ls`) to display the detailed documentation for the `ls` command, including its syntax, options, and description.  Use the **Up/Down arrow keys** or **Page Up/Page Down** to navigate the manual page. Press **`q`** to quit and return to the command prompt.  Note that the `man` command might not be available in all Windows environments, particularly in basic `cmd.exe`. However, it is typically available in Git Bash and WSL.

*   **`--help` flag:** Many commands support the `--help` flag as an alternative to `man`.  Typing `<command_name> --help` (e.g., `ls --help`) will display a concise help message outlining the command's usage and common options. This is often a more readily accessible and universally supported help method across different operating systems and shells.

### Simple Utility Commands

Here are a few basic yet useful commands to get started:

*   **`whoami`:** Displays the username of the currently logged-in user.

*   **`date`:** Shows the current date and time.

*   **`clear`:** Clears the terminal screen, providing a clean slate.  `Ctrl + L` shortcut achieves the same outcome.

## Navigating the File System

A fundamental aspect of command line proficiency is the ability to navigate the file system efficiently. These commands are your tools for moving between directories and understanding your current location.

### File System Navigation Commands

*   **`pwd` (Print Working Directory):** Displays the absolute path of your current directory (also known as the working directory).  This command helps you determine your current location within the file system hierarchy. The output will typically be a path starting from the root directory (`/` on Unix-like systems, `C:\` on Windows). The tilde character (`~`) often represents your home directory in the output.

    > **Working Directory:** The current directory in the file system that the command line is operating within. Commands are executed relative to this directory unless an absolute path is specified.

*   **`ls` (List Directory Contents):** Lists the files and directories within the current directory.  Without any options, `ls` displays the names of files and directories in the current working directory.

    *   **`ls <directory_path>`:** To list the contents of a specific directory, provide the directory path as an argument (e.g., `ls downloads` to list the contents of the "downloads" directory).
    *   **`ls -a` (All):**  Includes hidden files and directories in the listing.  Hidden files and directories in Unix-like systems typically begin with a dot (`.`).
    *   **`ls -l` (Long Listing):**  Displays detailed information about files and directories, including permissions, owner, group, file size, and modification date.
    *   **`ls -al` or `ls -la` (All and Long Listing):** Combines the `-a` and `-l` options to show all files (including hidden) with detailed information.
    *   **`ls -r` (Reverse Order):** Lists the contents in reverse order (alphabetically or by modification time, depending on other options).

*   **`cd` (Change Directory):** Changes the current working directory.

    *   **`cd <directory_path>`:**  Changes the directory to the specified path (e.g., `cd downloads` to enter the "downloads" directory).
    *   **`cd` (or `cd ~`):**  Changes the directory to your home directory.
    *   **`cd ..` (Parent Directory):** Moves one level up to the parent directory of the current directory.
    *   **`cd -` (Previous Directory):** Returns to the previously visited directory.
    *   **`cd /` (Root Directory):** Changes the directory to the root directory of the file system (the top-level directory).

### Opening Files and Folders in the GUI

While the command line is powerful, sometimes you need to interact with files and folders using the graphical interface.  The following commands allow you to open files and directories in your operating system's default GUI file explorer from the command line:

*   **`open <file_path>` or `open <directory_path>` (macOS):** Opens the specified file or directory in Finder (macOS's file explorer).

*   **`start <file_path>` or `start <directory_path>` (Windows):** Opens the specified file or directory in File Explorer (Windows' file explorer).

*   **`xdg-open <file_path>` or `xdg-open <directory_path>` (Linux):** Opens the specified file or directory using the default application associated with the file type or the default file manager on Linux distributions.

*   **`open <URL>` (macOS):**  Opens the specified URL in your default web browser.  Similar commands or utilities might exist on Windows and Linux to open URLs from the command line.

## Working with Files and Directories

Beyond navigation, the command line enables you to create, modify, and manage files and directories directly.

### File and Directory Manipulation Commands

*   **`mkdir` (Make Directory):** Creates a new directory.

    *   **`mkdir <directory_name>`:** Creates a new directory with the specified name in the current working directory (e.g., `mkdir my_project` creates a directory named "my_project").

*   **`touch`:** Creates a new empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

    *   **`touch <file_name>`:** Creates a new empty file with the specified name in the current working directory (e.g., `touch index.html` creates an empty file named "index.html").
    *   **`touch <file1> <file2> <file3> ...`:** Creates multiple files simultaneously.

*   **`rm` (Remove):** Deletes files and directories.

    *   **`rm <file_name>`:** Deletes the specified file.
    *   **`rm -i <file_name>` (Interactive Remove):** Prompts for confirmation before deleting the file.
    *   **`rm -r <directory_name>` (Recursive Remove):** Deletes the specified directory and its contents (subdirectories and files). **Use with caution!**
    *   **`rm -rf <directory_name>` (Recursive and Force Remove):** Forcefully deletes the directory and its contents without prompting for confirmation. **Extremely dangerous, use with extreme caution!**  This command bypasses safety checks and can lead to irreversible data loss if used incorrectly.

*   **`cp` (Copy):** Copies files and directories.

    *   **`cp <source_file> <destination_file>`:** Copies the source file to the destination file.
    *   **`cp <source_file> <destination_directory>`:** Copies the source file into the destination directory, keeping the original filename.
    *   **`cp -r <source_directory> <destination_directory>` (Recursive Copy):** Copies a directory and its contents recursively.

*   **`mv` (Move):** Moves or renames files and directories.

    *   **`mv <source_file> <destination_file>`:** Moves or renames the source file to the destination file. If the destination is an existing directory, the file is moved into that directory. If the destination is a new filename in the same directory, the file is renamed.
    *   **`mv <source_directory> <destination_directory>`:** Moves the source directory into the destination directory.
    *   **`mv <old_name> <new_name>` (Rename):** Renames a file or directory.

## Viewing File Content

The command line provides several tools for inspecting the contents of files without needing to open them in a graphical text editor.

### File Content Viewing Commands

*   **`cat` (Concatenate):** Displays the entire content of a file to the terminal.  `cat` is primarily used to view the contents of small to medium-sized files. For large files, `less` is more efficient.

    *   **`cat <file_name>`:** Displays the content of the specified file.
    *   **`cat > <file_name>`:** Redirects standard input to a file, allowing you to write content directly into the file from the command line. Overwrites the file if it exists, creates it if it doesn't. Press **Ctrl + D** to end input and save.
    *   **`cat >> <file_name>`:** Appends standard input to a file. Adds content to the end of an existing file or creates the file if it doesn't exist. Press **Ctrl + D** to end input and save.
    *   **`cat -n <file_name>`:** Displays the content of the file with line numbers.

*   **`less`:** Displays file content page by page, allowing for scrolling and navigation within the file.  `less` is ideal for viewing large files as it only loads a portion of the file into memory at a time.

    *   **`less <file_name>`:** Opens the file in the `less` viewer. Use **Up/Down arrow keys**, **Page Up/Page Down**, or **Spacebar** to navigate. Press **`q`** to quit.

*   **`head`:** Displays the beginning of a file (by default, the first 10 lines).

    *   **`head <file_name>`:** Displays the first 10 lines of the file.
    *   **`head -n <number> <file_name>`:** Displays the first `<number>` lines of the file.

*   **`tail`:** Displays the end of a file (by default, the last 10 lines).  `tail` is often used to monitor log files in real-time using the `-f` (follow) option, which displays new lines as they are added to the file.

    *   **`tail <file_name>`:** Displays the last 10 lines of the file.
    *   **`tail -n <number> <file_name>`:** Displays the last `<number>` lines of the file.

## Text Editors in the Terminal

While you can use GUI text editors, the command line also offers text editors that run directly within the terminal. These are particularly useful when working on remote servers or in environments without a GUI.

### Terminal-Based Text Editors

*   **`nano`:** A simple and user-friendly terminal-based text editor, often pre-installed on Linux and macOS systems, and available in Git Bash on Windows.  `nano` is a good starting point for beginners due to its straightforward interface and helpful on-screen prompts for commands.

    *   **`nano <file_name>`:** Opens the specified file in the `nano` editor. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created when you save.
    *   **Basic `nano` operations:**
        *   Edit text directly in the editor.
        *   **Ctrl + X:** Exit `nano`. Prompts to save changes if modified.
        *   **Ctrl + O:** Write (save) the current file.
        *   **Ctrl + W:** Search for text within the file.

*   **`vim` (Vi IMproved):** A powerful and highly configurable text editor widely used in Unix-like environments. `vim` has a steeper learning curve than `nano` but offers significant efficiency and features for experienced users.

*   **`emacs`:** Another highly powerful and extensible text editor, often compared to `vim`.  Like `vim`, `emacs` has a substantial learning curve but provides immense flexibility and customization.

For beginners, `nano` is the recommended terminal text editor due to its ease of use. As you become more comfortable with the command line, you can explore `vim` or `emacs` for more advanced text editing capabilities.

## Searching File Content

The command line provides powerful tools for searching for specific text patterns within files.

### Content Searching Commands

*   **`grep` (Global Regular Expression Print):** Searches for lines in files that match a specified pattern (regular expression). `grep` is a versatile tool for filtering and extracting information from text files.

    *   **`grep "<search_term>" <file_name>`:** Searches for lines containing `<search_term>` in the specified file and prints the matching lines to the terminal. Enclose search terms with spaces in quotes.
    *   **`grep "<search_term>" <file1> <file2> <file3> ...`:** Searches multiple files for the search term.
    *   `grep -i "<search_term>" <file_name>`: Case-insensitive search.
    *   `grep -r "<search_term>" <directory_path>`: Recursive search within a directory and its subdirectories.

## Finding Files and Directories

The `find` command is a powerful utility for locating files and directories based on various criteria, such as name, type, size, modification time, and more.

### File and Directory Finding Commands

*   **`find <search_path> <options> <criteria>`:**  The general syntax of the `find` command.

    *   **`<search_path>`:** The directory to start the search from (e.g., `. ` for the current directory, `/` for the root directory, `~` for the home directory).
    *   **`<options>`:**  Options to modify the find behavior (e.g., `-name`, `-type`, `-empty`, `-delete`).
    *   **`<criteria>`:**  Specifies what to search for (e.g., filename pattern, file type, empty files).

    *   **`find . -name "<filename_pattern>"`:** Finds files and directories in the current directory and its subdirectories that match the `<filename_pattern>`. Use wildcards like `*` (matches any sequence of characters) and `?` (matches any single character) in the pattern. Enclose patterns with wildcards in quotes to prevent shell expansion.
    *   **`find . -type f`:** Finds only files.
    *   **`find . -type d`:** Finds only directories.
    *   **`find . -empty`:** Finds empty files and directories.
    *   **`find . -name "<filename_pattern>" -delete`:** Finds files matching the pattern and deletes them. **Use `-delete` with extreme caution!** Test your `find` command without `-delete` first to ensure it selects the intended files.

## Piping and Redirection

**Piping** and **redirection** are essential command line concepts that allow you to combine commands and control the flow of data between them.

### Piping

**Piping (`|`)** allows you to send the output of one command as the input to another command. This creates a chain of commands where the output of each command becomes the input for the next.

*   **`<command1> | <command2>`:** Executes `command1` and sends its standard output to `command2` as standard input.

    *   **Example:** `ls -l | grep ".txt"`: Lists files in long listing format (`ls -l`) and pipes the output to `grep ".txt"`, which filters and displays only lines containing ".txt" (effectively listing only text files).

### Redirection

**Redirection** allows you to change the standard input, standard output, or standard error streams of a command.

*   **Output Redirection (`>` and `>>`):**

    *   **`>` (Overwrite):** Redirects the standard output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.
        *   **`<command> > <file_name>`:** Executes `<command>` and saves its output to `<file_name>`, replacing the file's contents if it already exists.
    *   **`>>` (Append):** Redirects the standard output of a command to a file, appending the output to the end of the file if it exists, or creating the file if it doesn't.
        *   **`<command> >> <file_name>`:** Executes `<command>` and appends its output to `<file_name>`.

    *   **Example:** `find . -name "*.txt" > output.txt`:  Finds all `.txt` files in the current directory and redirects the list of filenames to `output.txt`, overwriting `output.txt` if it exists.

## Symbolic Links (Sim Links)

A **symbolic link** or **sim link** is a special type of file that acts as a pointer or shortcut to another file or directory.  Sim links are analogous to shortcuts in Windows or aliases in macOS GUIs.

> **Symbolic Link (Sim Link):** A file system object that points to another file or directory. It acts as a shortcut, allowing access to the target file or directory through the sim link.

### Sim Link Commands

*   **`ln -s <target_path> <link_path>` (Linux/macOS):** Creates a symbolic link.

    *   **`ln -s <path_to_original_file_or_directory> <path_for_sim_link>`:** Creates a sim link at `<path_for_sim_link>` that points to the target at `<path_to_original_file_or_directory>`.

    *   **Example:** `ln -s ~/downloads dlds`: Creates a sim link named "dlds" in the current directory that points to your downloads directory (`~/downloads`).

*   **`mklink <link_path> <target_path>` (Windows `cmd.exe`):** Creates symbolic links on Windows command prompt (not Git Bash). The order of arguments is reversed compared to `ln -s`.

    *   **`mklink <path_for_sim_link> <path_to_original_file_or_directory>`:** Creates a sim link at `<path_for_sim_link>` that points to the target at `<path_to_original_file_or_directory>`.

    *   **Example:** `mklink dlds C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads`: Creates a sim link named "dlds" in the current directory that points to your downloads directory.  *(Note: Replace `C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads` with the actual path to your downloads directory).*

*   **`rm <link_path>`:** Deletes a symbolic link.  Deleting a sim link only removes the link itself, not the original file or directory it points to.

## File Compression and Tarballs

**Tarballs** are a common archive format, particularly in Linux and Unix-like environments, used to bundle multiple files and directories together, often with compression.

> **Tarball:** An archive file format, commonly used in Unix-like systems, that bundles multiple files and directories into a single file. Tarballs are often compressed using gzip or other compression algorithms to reduce file size.

### Tarball Commands

*   **`tar` (Tape Archive):** The command for creating and manipulating tar archives.

    *   **`tar -czvf <archive_name>.tar.gz <directory_to_compress>` (Create and Compress):** Creates a compressed tar archive (tarball) of a directory.

        *   **`-c` (Create):** Creates a new archive.
        *   **`-z` (gzip):** Compresses the archive using gzip.
        *   **`-v` (Verbose):** Displays progress information during archiving.
        *   **`-f <archive_name>.tar.gz` (File):** Specifies the name of the archive file.
        *   **`<directory_to_compress>`:** The directory to be archived.

        *   **Example:** `tar -czvf source.tar.gz src`: Creates a compressed tarball named "source.tar.gz" containing the "src" directory.

    *   **`tar -tzvf <archive_name>.tar.gz` (List Contents):** Lists the contents of a tarball without extracting it.

        *   **`-t` (List):** Lists the contents of an archive.
        *   Other options (`-z`, `-v`, `-f`) are the same as in the create command.

        *   **Example:** `tar -tzvf source.tar.gz`: Lists the files and directories contained within "source.tar.gz".

    *   **`tar -xzvf <archive_name>.tar.gz` (Extract):** Extracts the contents of a tarball.

        *   **`-x` (Extract):** Extracts files from an archive.
        *   Other options (`-z`, `-v`, `-f`) are the same as in the create command.

        *   **Example:** `tar -xzvf source.tar.gz`: Extracts the contents of "source.tar.gz" into the current directory.

## Command History

The command line keeps a history of commands you have executed, allowing you to recall and reuse previous commands easily.

### History Command

*   **`history`:** Displays a numbered list of recently executed commands.

    *   **`history`:** Shows the command history.

    *   **`!<command_number>`:** Executes the command from the history list corresponding to `<command_number>`.

        *   **Example:** `!1602`: Re-executes the command with number 1602 from the `history` list.
