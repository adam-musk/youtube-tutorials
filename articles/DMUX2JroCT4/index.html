<h2 id="introduction-to-generative-ai-model-evaluation">Introduction to Generative AI Model Evaluation</h2>
<p>This chapter delves into a comparative analysis of three prominent open chat GPT models: GPT-4o, ChatGPT-1, and ChatGPT-3 Mini.  These models, representing advancements in the field of <strong>generative AI</strong>, are evaluated based on their performance across a range of tasks designed to test different cognitive and creative abilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Generative AI:</strong> A type of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, audio, and code, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data. These models learn patterns from training data and then use this learning to generate novel outputs that resemble the data they were trained on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evaluation is structured around five diverse prompt categories, each designed to challenge the models in specific areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Affairs and General Knowledge:</strong> Assessing the models' ability to understand and analyze recent events.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Mathematics:</strong> Testing logical reasoning and problem-solving skills in a mathematical context.</li>
<li><strong>Code Generation:</strong> Evaluating the models' capacity to generate functional and well-documented code.</li>
<li><strong>Logical Reasoning:</strong> Examining the models' proficiency in solving classic logic puzzles.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Image Generation:</strong> Exploring the models' capabilities in transforming textual descriptions into visual content (where applicable) and generating effective prompts for external tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>This comparative study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of each model, offering valuable insights into their suitability for various educational and practical applications.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-design-prompt-categories-and-model-responses">Experimental Design: Prompt Categories and Model Responses</h2>
<p>To rigorously assess the capabilities of GPT-4o, ChatGPT-1, and ChatGPT-3 Mini, we employed a series of carefully designed <strong>prompts</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> In the context of generative AI, a prompt is a text input given to a model to instruct it on the desired output. It serves as the starting point and guiding instruction for the model's generation process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each model was presented with identical prompts within each of the five categories. The responses were then analyzed based on accuracy, clarity, detail, and efficiency. The following sections detail the prompts used and the observed responses from each model.</p>
<h3 id="general-knowledge-and-reasoning-delhi-assembly-elections">General Knowledge and Reasoning: Delhi Assembly Elections</h3>
<p>This section evaluates the models' ability to process and analyze current events, specifically focusing on the political landscape of Delhi, India.</p>

<p>ChatGPT-1 provided details from the 2020 Delhi elections, stating that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by Arvind Kejriwal, secured 62 out of 70 seats, while the BJP managed only eight seats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While ChatGPT-1 delivers a detailed <strong>historical analysis</strong>, its response is based on older data due to the web search features being disabled. This limitation means it misses the latest updates from the 2025 elections.</p>
<p><strong>Historical analysis:</strong> The examination and interpretation of past events and trends. In the context of AI models, it refers to the model's ability to access and process information from past datasets and events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ChatGPT-3 Mini Response and Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT-3 Mini reported that in the most recent elections, the BJP secured a decisive victory by winning 48 out of 70 seats, while the Aam Aadmi Party managed to win only 22 seats. It also highlighted key contributing factors such as anti-incumbency, corruption controversies, and effective campaigning strategies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT-3 Mini delivered a detailed and well-sourced analysis, highlighting key factors such as <strong>anti-incumbency</strong>, corruption controversies, and effective campaigning strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-incumbency:</strong>  A sentiment against a political party or individual currently in power, often arising from dissatisfaction with their performance or policies. This sentiment can significantly influence election outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>GPT-4o and ChatGPT-3 Mini demonstrated superior performance in this category by providing up-to-date information reflecting the hypothetical 2025 election results. GPT-4o's real-time data integration via its web search feature was particularly noteworthy.

</blockquote>
<h3 id="logical-reasoning-bridge-and-torch-puzzle">Logical Reasoning: Bridge and Torch Puzzle</h3>
<p>This section tests the models' logical reasoning abilities using the classic Bridge and Torch puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Four people need to cross a bridge at night. They only have one torch, and the bridge is narrow, so at most two people can cross at a time. The torch must be used for every crossing. Person A takes 1 minute to cross, Person B takes 2 minutes, Person C takes 5 minutes, and Person D takes 10 minutes. When two people cross together, they move at the pace of the slower person. What is the minimum time required for all four people to cross the bridge? Provide a step-by-step explanation of your solution.</p>
<p><strong>GPT-4o Response and Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>GPT-4o outlined the puzzle, detailed a step-by-step strategy, and correctly identified the <strong>optimal solution</strong> as 17 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Optimal solution:</strong> The best possible solution to a problem, often in terms of minimizing time, cost, or resources, or maximizing efficiency or effectiveness. In this puzzle, it refers to the solution that achieves the minimum total crossing time.</p>
<p>GPT-4o begins by outlining the puzzle, then it details a step-by-step strategy, and after all the calculation, it gives the answer as 17 minutes, which is the minimum time required for all four to cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ChatGPT-1 Response and Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT-1 clearly outlined the puzzle, detailing crossing times and <strong>constraints</strong>, and also arrived at the optimal solution of 17 minutes. Its explanation highlighted the strategy of using the fastest person for return trips and sending the slowest people together to minimize total time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong>  Limitations or restrictions that must be considered when solving a problem. In the Bridge and Torch puzzle, constraints include the number of people who can cross at once, the need for the torch, and individual crossing times.</p>
<p>ChatGPT-1 began by clearly outlining the puzzle, detailing the crossing times for individuals along with the constraints and the rule that the slower person's pace governs each crossing. Then it comes up with the answer at 17 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ChatGPT-3 Mini Response and Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT-3 Mini also correctly identified the optimal solution of 17 minutes. Its explanation emphasized using the fastest individuals as shuttles for the torch to minimize extra trips and provided a clear and concise breakdown of the optimal sequence of moves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT-3 Mini starts by outlining the key area: using the fastest individuals as shuttles for the torch to minimize extra trips. It then details the optimal sequence of moves, adding this up to give a total of 17 minutes, which is the minimum time required for all four to cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong></p>
