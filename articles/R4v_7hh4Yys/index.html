<h2 id="1-introduction-to-website-creation-with-wordpress">1. Introduction to Website Creation with WordPress</h2>
<p>Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building your own website using WordPress, even without any coding experience. This course is designed for beginners and will walk you through every step of the process, utilizing the latest WordPress technologies. This is an updated version of a popular WordPress course that has helped millions of people create their websites.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the essential steps, starting from setting up your website's foundation to customizing its design and content. Whether you need a website for a local business, a personal blog, or any other purpose, WordPress offers the flexibility and ease of use to bring your vision to life.</p>
<h2 id="2-initial-setup-domain-name-hosting-and-wordpress">2. Initial Setup: Domain Name, Hosting, and WordPress</h2>
<p>Before diving into customization, it's crucial to understand the foundational elements of a website. These include a domain name, hosting, and WordPress itself.</p>
<h3 id="21-understanding-domain-names">2.1 Understanding Domain Names</h3>
<p>A <strong>domain name</strong> is the address people type into their web browser to access your website. It's your website's unique identifier on the internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Domain Name:</strong>  A domain name is the unique web address that users type into a browser to find a specific website. It acts as a human-readable alias for the website's IP address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of domain names include <code>youtube.com</code>, <code>freecodecamp.org</code>, and <code>wordpress.org</code>. Choosing a relevant and memorable domain name is a crucial first step in establishing your online presence.</p>
<h3 id="22-understanding-hosting">2.2 Understanding Hosting</h3>
<p><strong>Hosting</strong> refers to the service that stores your website's files and data, making them accessible to visitors worldwide. When someone enters your domain name, their browser requests these files from a server, and the hosting provider ensures these files are readily available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hosting:</strong> Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. A hosting provider maintains servers where website files are stored and served to users upon request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company providing this server space and service is called a <strong>hosting provider</strong>. Selecting a reliable hosting provider is vital for website performance and accessibility.</p>
<h3 id="23-introducing-wordpress-a-content-management-system-cms">2.3 Introducing WordPress: A Content Management System (CMS)</h3>
<p><strong>WordPress</strong> is a powerful and user-friendly <strong>Content Management System (CMS)</strong>. It simplifies website creation by allowing you to build and manage your site graphically, without needing to write code like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Content Management System (CMS):</strong> A CMS is a software application that enables users to create, manage, and modify content on a website without requiring specialized technical knowledge. It typically includes features for content creation, organization, and publishing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WordPress is the world's most popular CMS, powering over 40% of all websites. Best of all, WordPress software itself is free to use, making it an accessible option for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="3-customizing-wordpress-for-your-needs">3. Customizing WordPress for Your Needs</h2>
<p>Once WordPress is installed, the real fun begins â€“ customization! You can tailor your website to suit various purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Business Website:</strong> Showcase services, locations, contact information, and customer testimonials.</li>
<li><strong>Blog:</strong> Share your thoughts, expertise, or creative content regularly with an audience.</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Display your work, projects, and skills to potential clients or employers.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce Store:</strong> Sell products or services online, manage inventory, and process payments (requires additional plugins and setup, not covered in detail in this introductory chapter).</li>
<li><strong>Community Forum:</strong> Create a platform for discussions, user interaction, and shared interests (requires specific plugins and configurations).</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress's flexibility allows you to adapt its design and functionality to match your specific <strong>use case</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> In technology and design, a use case describes a specific scenario or purpose for which a product or system is used. It outlines how a user interacts with the system to achieve a particular goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-updating-your-websites-design-and-appearance">4. Updating Your Website's Design and Appearance</h2>
<p>WordPress offers extensive design customization options. You have control over:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Look:</strong> Choose from thousands of themes to define the overall style and layout of your site.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery:</strong> Easily upload and integrate your own images to enhance visual appeal and branding.</li>
<li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> Select colors that align with your brand identity and create the desired mood for your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>This course will guide you through these design aspects, enabling you to create a website that truly reflects your vision.</p>
<h2 id="5-getting-your-domain-and-hosting-with-hostinger">5. Getting Your Domain and Hosting with Hostinger</h2>
<p>Acquiring a domain name and hosting are the initial steps that involve a financial investment, although they are relatively inexpensive.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Name Cost:</strong> Typically ranges from \$10 to \$20 per year.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting Cost:</strong>  For a simple website, hosting often starts around \$5 per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>This course recommends and utilizes <strong>Hostinger</strong> for domain and hosting services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hostinger:</strong> Hostinger is a web hosting provider that offers various hosting solutions, including shared hosting, VPS hosting, and cloud hosting. It's known for its affordable plans and user-friendly interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hostinger is sponsoring this course, and based on personal experience, it is recognized as a reliable hosting provider.</p>
<h3 id="51-choosing-a-hostinger-plan">5.1 Choosing a Hostinger Plan</h3>
<p>To begin, navigate to <code>hostinger.com</code>. Hostinger offers various plans; for this course, we will select the <strong>Premium</strong> plan, which is a cost-effective option suitable for beginners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Premium Plan:</strong> In the context of services, a premium plan usually refers to a mid-tier service package that offers a balance of features and affordability, often sitting between basic and business-level plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Premium plan, like most Hostinger plans, includes a free domain name. It also provides <strong>100GB SSD storage</strong>, which is sufficient for most beginner websites. More advanced plans offer increased storage and additional features, but the Premium plan is ideal for our current needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SSD Storage:</strong> Solid State Drive (SSD) storage is a type of data storage that uses flash memory to store data. SSDs are faster and more reliable than traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), leading to quicker website loading times.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="52-selecting-the-period-and-purchasing-hosting">5.2 Selecting the Period and Purchasing Hosting</h3>
<p>Choose the billing period for your hosting plan. Longer periods, such as 12 or 24 months, often come with significant discounts, reducing the monthly cost. Select the period that best suits your budget and commitment and proceed to continue with the purchase.</p>
<h3 id="53-creating-a-hostinger-account-and-website">5.3 Creating a Hostinger Account and Website</h3>
<p>After purchasing your plan, Hostinger will typically guide you through the process of creating your first website. If not, access your Hostinger dashboard and initiate the website creation process.</p>
<p>Choose to create a website and specify that it will be a WordPress site. Remember your WordPress administrator email and password, as these will be needed to manage your website later. For the initial setup, select "Create a blank site."</p>
<h3 id="54-choosing-a-domain-name">5.4 Choosing a Domain Name</h3>
<p>As part of the setup, you will be prompted to choose a domain name. With the Premium plan, you receive a free domain. For this demonstration, we will use the example domain <code>isitmondaytoday.com</code>. Your domain name should be relevant to your website's purpose.</p>
<p>It's important to note that domain names are unique, and you may need to try a few variations before finding one that is available.</p>
<h3 id="55-selecting-a-data-center">5.5 Selecting a Data Center</h3>
<p>You will need to select a <strong>Data Center</strong> for your website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Data Center:</strong> A data center is a dedicated facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. In web hosting, data centers are where servers that host websites are physically located.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data center's location can impact website loading speed, especially for visitors geographically closer to it. Ideally, choose a data center closest to your target audience. However, websites are globally accessible regardless of the data center location. For this example, we will choose a data center in Michigan, as it is geographically relevant.</p>
<h3 id="56-wordpress-installation">5.6 WordPress Installation</h3>
<p>After selecting the data center, Hostinger will automatically install WordPress on your hosting account. The installation process may vary slightly depending on the hosting provider, but once WordPress is installed, the steps for setting up and building your website are generally consistent across providers.</p>
<h2 id="6-navigating-the-wordpress-and-hostinger-dashboards">6. Navigating the WordPress and Hostinger Dashboards</h2>
<p>Upon successful WordPress installation, you will be directed to the <strong>WordPress dashboard</strong>, the administrative control panel for your website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WordPress Dashboard:</strong> The WordPress dashboard is the administrative interface of a WordPress website. It provides access to various website management tools, including content creation, design customization, plugin and theme management, and settings configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may also encounter a Hostinger-specific onboarding section within the WordPress dashboard, which is unique to Hostinger hosting. This might include features like an <strong>AI content creator</strong>, which can assist in generating website content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AI Content Creator:</strong> An AI content creator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to generate text, images, or other forms of content. In the context of web hosting, it can help users quickly create initial content for their websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="61-connecting-your-domain">6.1 Connecting Your Domain</h3>
<p>Initially, your website might be accessible through a temporary domain provided by Hostinger (e.g., <code>preview-domain.com</code>). To use your chosen domain name (<code>isitmondaytoday.com</code>), you need to connect it within the Hostinger <strong>HPanel</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HPanel:</strong> HPanel is Hostinger's proprietary web hosting control panel. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing hosting services, domains, email accounts, and other aspects of your website hosting environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Access the HPanel through the provided link or by navigating to the Hostinger homepage. In HPanel, locate the domain connection settings and initiate the process to connect your domain. Domain connection may take up to 24 hours to fully propagate across the internet, but often it's much quicker.</p>
<h3 id="62-exploring-the-hostinger-hpanel">6.2 Exploring the Hostinger HPanel</h3>
<p>While the domain is connecting, take a moment to explore the Hostinger HPanel. This is where you manage your hosting account, including email setup, backups, and other hosting-related settings.</p>
<h2 id="7-setting-up-email-on-your-domain">7. Setting Up Email on Your Domain</h2>
<p>A professional email address using your domain name (e.g., <code>bo@isitmondaytoday.com</code>) enhances your website's credibility. Hostinger provides a free email service with its hosting plans.</p>
<h3 id="71-creating-a-free-email-account">7.1 Creating a Free Email Account</h3>
<p>Within the HPanel, navigate to the "Emails" section and set up your free email service. Choose a username (e.g., <code>bo</code>) and create a password for your email account.</p>
<h3 id="72-verifying-domain-email">7.2 Verifying Domain Email</h3>
<p>Before finalizing email setup, you may need to verify your domain email address. Hostinger will send a verification email to the email address associated with your domain registration (e.g., the freeCodeCamp.org email in this example). Follow the instructions in the verification email to confirm your domain ownership.</p>
<h3 id="73-accessing-webmail-and-sending-test-emails">7.3 Accessing Webmail and Sending Test Emails</h3>
<p>Once verified, you can access your new email account through <strong>webmail</strong>, a browser-based email client.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Webmail:</strong> Webmail is an email service that allows users to access and manage their emails through a web browser, as opposed to a desktop email client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can access Hostinger webmail directly through <code>mail.hostinger.com</code> and log in using your newly created email address and password. Send a test email to ensure your email account is working correctly. You can also configure email forwarding to redirect emails to another email address you regularly use, simplifying email management.</p>
<h2 id="8-accessing-the-wordpress-admin-dashboard-directly">8. Accessing the WordPress Admin Dashboard Directly</h2>
<p>While you can access the WordPress dashboard through the Hostinger panel, you can also access it directly by typing your domain name followed by <code>/wp-admin</code> in your browser's address bar (e.g., <code>isitmondaytoday.com/wp-admin</code>).</p>
<p>This direct access method bypasses the Hostinger panel and takes you straight to the WordPress login page (if you are not already logged in). After logging in, you will be at the WordPress dashboard, regardless of your hosting provider.</p>
<h2 id="9-exploring-the-wordpress-dashboard-and-website-frontend">9. Exploring the WordPress Dashboard and Website Frontend</h2>
<p>The WordPress dashboard is your central hub for managing your website. From here, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and edit pages and posts</li>
<li>Customize your website's design</li>
<li>Install plugins and themes</li>
<li>Manage users</li>
<li>Adjust settings</li>
</ul>
<p>To view your website as visitors see it, click on your website's name in the top left corner of the WordPress dashboard. This will open the <strong>website frontend</strong>, the public-facing part of your site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Website Frontend:</strong> The frontend of a website is the part that users directly interact with. It includes the visual design, content, and interactive elements that are displayed in a web browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will notice a black bar at the top of the frontend when you are logged in as an administrator. This bar is only visible to logged-in administrators and provides quick access to the dashboard and customization options. Regular website visitors will not see this bar.</p>
<h2 id="10-basic-wordpress-settings-configuration">10. Basic WordPress Settings Configuration</h2>
<p>Let's begin customizing your WordPress website by adjusting some fundamental settings. Navigate to "Settings" in the WordPress dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="101-general-settings">10.1 General Settings</h3>
<p>In "General Settings," you can modify:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site Title:</strong> Change the default title to your desired website name (e.g., "Is it Monday Today").</li>
<li><strong>Tagline:</strong> Add a short description or slogan for your website (e.g., "Learn if it is Monday").</li>
<li><strong>Administrative Email Address:</strong> Verify or change the email address associated with website administration.</li>
<li><strong>Date and Time Formats:</strong> Customize how dates and times are displayed on your website.</li>
<li><strong>Week Starts On:</strong> Set the first day of the week for calendar-related features.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="102-permalink-settings">10.2 Permalink Settings</h3>
<p><strong>Permalinks</strong> are the permanent URLs of your website's posts and pages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Permalinks:</strong> Permalinks are permanent URLs to your individual web pages, blog posts, and other archives. They are designed to be stable and unchanging, making them ideal for sharing and SEO purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For better <strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</strong>, it is recommended to set your permalinks to "Post name."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong> SEO is the process of optimizing your website to improve its visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). Effective SEO can increase organic traffic to your website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This option makes URLs more readable and includes relevant keywords, which can improve search engine rankings.  Avoid the "Plain" setting, which uses post numbers instead of descriptive names.</p>
<h2 id="11-enhancing-functionality-with-plugins-and-themes">11. Enhancing Functionality with Plugins and Themes</h2>
<p>WordPress's power and flexibility are largely due to <strong>plugins</strong> and <strong>themes</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plugins:</strong> WordPress plugins are software add-ons that extend the functionality of a WordPress website. They can add new features, integrate with third-party services, and customize various aspects of your site.</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong> WordPress themes control the visual design and layout of your website. They provide the structure and styling for your site's frontend, determining how content is presented to visitors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="111-managing-plugins">11.1 Managing Plugins</h3>
<p>Plugins are like apps for your website, adding extra features and functionalities. By default, WordPress may come with some pre-installed plugins. You can manage plugins by navigating to "Plugins" in the WordPress dashboard.</p>
<p>It's good practice to remove unnecessary plugins, especially those you don't plan to use. For example, you can deactivate and delete the "Hostinger Easy Onboarding" plugin if you prefer to learn the setup process manually.</p>
<h3 id="112-installing-essential-plugins">11.2 Installing Essential Plugins</h3>
<p>For this course, we will install three essential plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Elementor Website Builder:</strong> A popular drag-and-drop page builder that allows you to create visually appealing pages without coding. Search for "Elementor" in the "Add New Plugin" section, install, and activate it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Elementor Website Builder:</strong> Elementor is a popular WordPress page builder plugin that offers a drag-and-drop interface for creating and customizing website pages visually. It simplifies web design and is widely used by both beginners and professionals.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WPForms:</strong> A user-friendly form builder that simplifies creating contact forms and other types of forms. Search for "WPForms," install, and activate it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WPForms:</strong> WPForms is a WordPress plugin designed to create various types of forms, including contact forms, surveys, and registration forms. It offers a drag-and-drop interface and is known for its ease of use.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="113-installing-and-activating-a-theme">11.3 Installing and Activating a Theme</h3>
<p>Themes control your website's design. Navigate to "Appearance" &gt; "Themes" and click "Add New." Search for the <strong>Astra</strong> theme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Astra Theme:</strong> Astra is a lightweight and highly customizable WordPress theme known for its speed and compatibility with page builders like Elementor. It offers a wide range of customization options and is a popular choice for various types of websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Astra is a fast and lightweight theme that works seamlessly with Elementor. Install and activate the Astra theme.</p>
<h3 id="114-utilizing-starter-templates">11.4 Utilizing Starter Templates</h3>
<p>Astra offers <strong>starter templates</strong>, pre-designed website layouts that you can import and customize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Starter Templates:</strong> Starter templates are pre-designed website layouts provided by theme developers. They offer a quick way to set up a website with a professional design, which can then be customized to fit specific needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After activating Astra, you will find "Starter Templates" under "Appearance" &gt; "Astra Options." Install and activate the Starter Templates plugin. When prompted, choose Elementor as your page builder.</p>
<p>Browse through the available templates and select one that aligns with your desired website style. Remember, all templates are fully customizable. For this example, we will choose a nature-themed template as a starting point, but any template can be adapted. You can preview and customize aspects like fonts and color palettes before importing a template.</p>
<p>Once you select a template, you can choose to import the complete website or individual pages. For this course, we will import the complete website to get a fully functional starting point.</p>
<h2 id="12-customizing-website-design-with-elementor">12. Customizing Website Design with Elementor</h2>
<p>With a template installed, you can begin customizing your website's content and design using Elementor.</p>
<h3 id="121-customizing-the-logo">12.1 Customizing the Logo</h3>
<p>Let's start by creating and changing the website logo. We will use <strong>Canva</strong>, a user-friendly online graphic design tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Canva:</strong> Canva is a popular online graphic design platform that offers a wide range of templates and tools for creating visual content, including logos, social media graphics, presentations, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a Logo in Canva:</strong> Go to <code>canva.com</code> and search for logo templates. Create a simple logo relevant to your website's theme. For our "Is it Monday Today" website, we will create a calendar-themed logo with a large "M" for Monday.</li>
<li><strong>Download Logo Versions:</strong> Download two versions of your logo:<ul>
<li><strong>Black Logo:</strong> For light backgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>White Logo:</strong> For dark backgrounds.
Ensure you download them with a transparent background and at a size of 250x250 pixels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="122-changing-the-logo-in-wordpress">12.2 Changing the Logo in WordPress</h3>
<p>To change the logo on your website:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access WordPress Customizer:</strong> Click the "Customize" button in the WordPress admin bar.</li>
<li><strong>Edit Header:</strong> Hover over the existing logo in the header, and an "Edit" icon (pencil icon) should appear. Click on it.</li>
<li><strong>Change Image:</strong> In the Customizer sidebar, click "Change Image" to replace the existing logo.</li>
<li><strong>Upload Logos:</strong> Drag and drop your black and white logo files into the media library.</li>
<li><strong>Select Logo:</strong> Choose the white logo for the main header and click "Choose Image."</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Logo Size (Optional):</strong> Use the logo width settings in the Customizer to adjust the logo's size as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Publish Changes:</strong> Click "Publish" in the Customizer to save your logo changes.</li>

<p>You might notice a second logo in the footer. Repeat the process to update the footer logo, this time using the black logo for better visibility on a potentially lighter footer background.</p>
<h3 id="123-understanding-header-and-footer-customization-vs-elementor">12.3 Understanding Header and Footer Customization vs. Elementor</h3>
<p>It's important to understand that header and footer elements are typically customized through the WordPress <strong>Customizer</strong>, while the main page content is edited using <strong>Elementor</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WordPress Customizer:</strong> The WordPress Customizer is a built-in tool that allows users to customize various aspects of their website's appearance in a live preview environment. It's primarily used for site-wide design settings, such as header, footer, colors, and typography.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Customizer controls site-wide elements like headers, footers, and menus that are consistent across all pages. Elementor, on the other hand, is used to design and modify the content within individual pages.</p>
<h3 id="124-editing-page-content-with-elementor">12.4 Editing Page Content with Elementor</h3>
<p>To customize the main content of your pages, you will use the "Edit with Elementor" option.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Navigate to Page:</strong> Go to the page you want to edit (e.g., your homepage) on the website frontend.</li>
<li><strong>Click "Edit with Elementor":</strong> Click the "Edit with Elementor" button in the WordPress admin bar. This will open the Elementor editor for that page.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="125-customizing-text-and-styles-in-elementor">12.5 Customizing Text and Styles in Elementor</h3>

<li><strong>Customize Styles:</strong> Go to the "Style" tab to adjust text alignment, typography (font, size, weight), text color, text stroke, text shadow, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Settings:</strong> The "Advanced" tab allows you to control margins, padding, and other layout and positioning properties.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="126-changing-background-images-in-elementor">12.6 Changing Background Images in Elementor</h3>
<p>To change the background image of a section or container:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Select Section/Container:</strong> Click the six dots at the top of the section or container you want to modify. This will select the entire section or container for editing.</li>
<li><strong>Go to Style Tab:</strong> In the Elementor sidebar, go to the "Style" tab.</li>
<li><strong>Background Settings:</strong> Under "Background," you will find options to change the background type (classic, gradient, video) and image.</li>
<li><strong>Choose New Image:</strong> Click "Choose Image" to select a new background image from your media library or upload a new one.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Background Options:</strong> Explore other background options like position, size, repeat, and overlay to fine-tune the appearance.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="127-adding-and-modifying-sections-and-containers-in-elementor">12.7 Adding and Modifying Sections and Containers in Elementor</h3>
<p>Elementor uses a structure of sections and containers to organize page content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sections:</strong> Represent broad rows on your page.</li>
<li><strong>Containers:</strong> Divide sections into columns or areas to structure content within a section.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add, delete, duplicate, and rearrange sections and containers to create your desired layout. To add a new section, click the "+" icon in Elementor and choose a section structure (e.g., single column, two columns, etc.). To add a container within a section, right-click on an existing container and select "Add New Container" or choose a layout when adding a new element.</p>
<h3 id="128-adding-emojis-and-updating-the-features-section">12.8 Adding Emojis and Updating the Features Section</h3>

<h3 id="1211-contact-page-setup">12.11 Contact Page Setup</h3>
<p>The contact page often includes a contact form. The template likely includes a placeholder form. We will customize this form later using WPForms. For now, focus on updating the background image and other visual elements of the contact page using Elementor.</p>
<h3 id="1212-adding-new-sections-and-widgets">12.12 Adding New Sections and Widgets</h3>
<p>Elementor offers a wide range of <strong>widgets</strong>, which are content elements you can drag and drop onto your pages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Widgets:</strong> In WordPress, widgets are small blocks of content that can be added to various areas of a website, such as sidebars, footers, and now page content areas using page builders like Elementor. They provide pre-built functionalities and content elements.</p>

<h2 id="13-making-your-website-dynamic-with-html-and-javascript">13. Making Your Website Dynamic with HTML and JavaScript</h2>
<p>To make your website more interactive and dynamic, you can add custom code. For our "Is it Monday Today" website, we will add a dynamic element that displays whether it is Monday or not.</p>
<h3 id="131-adding-the-html-widget">13.1 Adding the HTML Widget</h3>
<p>Elementor provides an <strong>HTML widget</strong> that allows you to embed custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly into your pages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HTML Widget:</strong> In Elementor and other page builders, the HTML widget is a tool that allows users to insert custom HTML code directly into a webpage. This is useful for embedding scripts, custom elements, or content that requires HTML markup.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Add HTML Widget:</strong> In Elementor, search for "HTML" in the widget panel and drag the HTML widget to the desired location on your page (e.g., below the main heading on the homepage).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="132-custom-html-code-for-is-it-monday-functionality">13.2 Custom HTML Code for "Is it Monday?" Functionality</h3>
<p>Paste the following HTML and JavaScript code into the HTML widget's code area:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id=&quot;monday-status&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const dayOfWeek = new Date().getDay();
  const messageElement = document.getElementById('monday-status');
  if (dayOfWeek === 1) {
    messageElement.textContent = 'Yes, it is Monday!';
  } else {
    messageElement.textContent = 'No, it is not Monday. Enjoy your ' + getDayName(dayOfWeek) + '.';
  }

  function getDayName(dayIndex) {
    const days = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];
    return days[dayIndex];
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This code uses JavaScript to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the current day of the week.</li>
<li>Check if it is Monday (day index 1).</li>
<li>Display "Yes, it is Monday!" if it's Monday.</li>
<li>Otherwise, display "No, it is not Monday. Enjoy your [Day of the week]."</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="133-testing-and-adjusting-the-code">13.3 Testing and Adjusting the Code</h3>
<p>After adding the code, publish your page and view it live. The dynamic message should display based on the current day. You can modify the JavaScript code to change the messages, styling, or logic as needed.</p>
<h2 id="14-menu-customization">14. Menu Customization</h2>
