<h2 id="1-what-is-version-control-and-why-git">1. What is Version Control and Why Git?</h2>
<h3 id="11-the-need-for-version-control">1.1 The Need for Version Control</h3>
<p>Imagine working on a project, writing code, or creating any digital content. As you progress, you make changes, add features, and fix errors.  It's common to want to revisit previous versions of your work.  Perhaps you made a mistake and want to undo recent changes, or you want to compare different stages of your project's development.</p>
<p>Without a system to manage these versions, you might resort to manually copying folders or using simple undo functions within your editor. However, these methods are inefficient and prone to errors, especially in complex projects. This is where version control systems come into play.</p>
<p>Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to files over time. It allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revert to previous versions of files.</li>
<li>Compare changes made over time.</li>
<li>Collaborate effectively with others on the same project.</li>
<li>Understand the history of your project's development.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-introduction-to-git">1.2 Introduction to Git</h3>
<p><strong>Git</strong> is a powerful and widely used <strong>version control system</strong>. It is a tool that enables you to efficiently manage the history of your source code and other files.  Its popularity within the programming community makes understanding its basics highly valuable for anyone working with code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Version Control System:</strong> A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chapter will guide you through the fundamental concepts of Git and its basic functionalities.</p>
<h2 id="2-git-vs-github-understanding-the-difference">2. Git vs. GitHub: Understanding the Difference</h2>
<p>It's crucial to distinguish between Git and <strong>GitHub</strong>, especially for beginners.  While their names are similar, they serve different purposes.</p>
<h3 id="21-git-the-version-control-system">2.1 Git: The Version Control System</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Git itself is the version control system. You can download and install Git directly onto your computer from <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a>.  Once installed, Git operates as a <strong>local tool</strong>, meaning it primarily functions on your machine to manage your project's history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Local Tool:</strong> Software that is installed and runs directly on a user's computer, as opposed to a web-based or server-based application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Git enables you to track changes, save versions (commits), and manage branches within your project directly on your computer, even without an internet connection.</p>
<h3 id="22-github-the-hosting-provider">2.2 GitHub: The Hosting Provider</h3>
<p><strong>GitHub</strong>, accessible at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>, is a <strong>hosting and collaboration provider</strong> for Git <strong>repositories</strong>.  It is a web-based platform designed to host your Git repositories online, making them accessible over the internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hosting Provider:</strong> A company that provides services and infrastructure to host websites, applications, or in this case, code repositories, making them accessible online.
<strong>Repository:</strong> In Git, a repository is a storage location for your project's files and their revision history. It contains all the commits, branches, and other metadata associated with your project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GitHub offers several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote Backup:</strong> It provides a secure, off-site backup for your Git repositories.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> It facilitates collaboration among developers by allowing multiple people to access, contribute to, and manage the same codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Project Management:</strong> GitHub offers tools for project management, issue tracking, and code review, enhancing team workflows.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="23-alternatives-to-github">2.3 Alternatives to GitHub</h3>
<p>While GitHub is extremely popular, it's not the only hosting provider for Git repositories. Alternatives exist, such as <strong>AWS CodeCommit</strong>.  These platforms offer similar functionalities to GitHub, providing options based on specific needs and preferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AWS CodeCommit:</strong> A fully-managed source control service hosted by Amazon Web Services that hosts private Git repositories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's important to remember that Git is the underlying version control system, and GitHub (or alternatives) are platforms that provide hosting and collaborative features built around Git. You can use Git effectively without ever using GitHub, working entirely locally. However, for collaboration and online backup, platforms like GitHub are invaluable.</p>
<h2 id="3-core-git-concepts-repositories-branches-and-commits">3. Core Git Concepts: Repositories, Branches, and Commits</h2>
<p>To effectively use Git, understanding three fundamental concepts is essential: repositories, branches, and commits.</p>
<h3 id="31-repositories-the-code-history-location">3.1 Repositories: The Code History Location</h3>
<p>A <strong>repository</strong> (often shortened to "repo") is the central location where Git stores your project's code history. When you decide to manage a project with Git, you initialize a repository in your project's root directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Root Directory:</strong> The top-level directory in a file system hierarchy, in this context, it's the main folder of your project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This repository tracks all changes made to the files within that directory and its subdirectories.  It essentially becomes the database of your project's evolution over time.</p>
<h3 id="32-branches-organizing-code-within-repositories">3.2 Branches: Organizing Code within Repositories</h3>
<p>Within a repository, code is organized into <strong>branches</strong>.  Think of a branch as an independent line of development.  The most common branch is often called the "<strong>master branch</strong>" (or more recently, "<strong>main branch</strong>").</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Branch:</strong> A parallel version of a repository. It allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase.
<strong>Master Branch (Main Branch):</strong> The primary branch in a Git repository, often considered the stable version of the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Branches are crucial for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature Development:</strong>  Creating separate branches for new features allows developers to work on them without disrupting the main codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Branches can be used to isolate bug fixes, ensuring that the main branch remains stable.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel Development:</strong> Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously in their respective branches.</li>
</ul>
<p>While branches are conceptually similar to folders for organization, it is important to understand they are more than just file system directories. They represent distinct timelines of project development.</p>
<h3 id="33-commits-saving-code-versions">3.3 Commits: Saving Code Versions</h3>
<p>A <strong>commit</strong> represents a saved snapshot of your code at a specific point in time.  Each commit captures the changes you've made since the last commit.  Commits are the building blocks of your project's history within a branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Commit:</strong> A snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. It represents a saved version of your project and includes a message describing the changes made in that commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you make changes to your code and want to save them in Git, you create a commit. Each commit is accompanied by a commit message, which should briefly describe the changes included in that commit. These messages are vital for understanding the history of your project and the purpose of each change.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repository:</strong> Holds the entire project history and structure.</li>
<li><strong>Branch:</strong>  Organizes commits into separate lines of development (like folders representing different feature sets or versions).</li>
<li><strong>Commit:</strong> Saves a specific version or stage of your code within a branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three concepts work together to provide a powerful and flexible system for managing your code's evolution.</p>
<h2 id="4-getting-started-with-git-installation-and-basic-commands">4. Getting Started with Git: Installation and Basic Commands</h2>
<p>Now, let's move from theory to practice and learn how to use Git with basic commands.</p>
<h3 id="41-installing-git">4.1 Installing Git</h3>
<p>To begin using Git, you first need to install it on your system.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Download Git:</strong> Visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a> and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
<li><strong>Installation Process:</strong>  The installation process is generally straightforward. Follow the on-screen instructions.  For most users, the default settings are sufficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>After installation, Git is primarily used through the <strong>terminal</strong> or <strong>command prompt</strong>.  While some code editors offer integrated Git functionalities, understanding the command-line interface is crucial for grasping Git's core operations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Terminal (Command Prompt):</strong> A text-based interface used to interact with the operating system by typing commands. On Windows, it's often called "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell," and on macOS and Linux, it's typically called "Terminal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many code editors, like <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>, provide an <strong>integrated terminal</strong>, allowing you to execute Git commands directly within the editor environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Integrated Terminal:</strong> A terminal emulator embedded within a code editor, allowing developers to run command-line tools without leaving the editor.
<strong>Visual Studio Code (VS Code):</strong> A popular source code editor developed by Microsoft, known for its extensive features and extensibility, including integrated Git support.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="42-initializing-a-git-repository-git-init">4.2 Initializing a Git Repository (<code>git init</code>)</h3>
<p>To start using Git for a project, you need to initialize a Git repository in your project's folder.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Navigate to Project Folder:</strong> Open your terminal and use the <code>cd</code> command (change directory) to navigate to your project's root folder.  In Visual Studio Code, you can often open an integrated terminal already pointed to your project folder.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialize Repository:</strong> Once in your project folder, type the following command and press Enter:</p>
<p><code>bash
git init</code></p>
<p>This command initializes an empty Git repository in the current folder.  Git will create a hidden folder named <code>.git</code> within your project directory. This folder contains all the necessary repository objects and configurations.  <strong>It's important to ensure hidden files are visible in your file explorer to see the <code>.git</code> folder initially.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="43-tracking-files-git-add-and-staging-area">4.3 Tracking Files (<code>git add</code>) and Staging Area</h3>
<p>After initializing a repository, Git starts monitoring changes within your project folder. However, Git doesn't automatically track every file. You need to explicitly tell Git which files to include in version control using the <code>git add</code> command.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Repository Status:</strong>  Use the <code>git status</code> command to see the current state of your repository.  Initially, you'll see "Untracked files," indicating that Git is aware of the files but not yet tracking them.</p>
<p><code>bash
git status</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Untracked Files:</strong> Files in your working directory that Git is aware of but are not yet included in version control.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Files to Staging Area:</strong> To start tracking files, you need to add them to the <strong>staging area</strong>. The staging area is a temporary holding area where you prepare changes before committing them. To add all files in your current directory and subdirectories, use:</p>
<p><code>bash
git add .</code></p>
<p>The <code>.</code> (dot) in this command refers to the current directory. You can also add specific files by name (e.g., <code>git add index.html</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Staging Area:</strong>  An intermediate area in Git where changes are prepared to be included in the next commit. It allows you to selectively choose which changes to commit.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify Staged Files:</strong> Run <code>git status</code> again. You'll now see the added files listed in green under "Changes to be committed," indicating that they are staged and ready to be committed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="44-committing-changes-git-commit">4.4 Committing Changes (<code>git commit</code>)</h3>
<p>Once you have staged your changes, you can save them as a commit using the <code>git commit</code> command.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a Commit:</strong> To create a commit, use the following command:</p>
<p><code>bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"</code></p>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag is used to provide a commit message directly in the command.  Replace <code>"Your commit message here"</code> with a concise and descriptive message explaining the changes you are committing.  For example:</p>
<p><code>bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added index.html with basic structure"</code></p>
<p>Every commit should have a meaningful commit message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="45-viewing-repository-status-git-status">4.5 Viewing Repository Status (<code>git status</code>)</h3>
<p>As you've seen, <code>git status</code> is a valuable command to check the current state of your Git repository at any time. It provides information about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staged Changes:</strong> Changes that are ready to be committed.</li>
<li><strong>Unstaged Changes:</strong> Changes in tracked files that have not yet been added to the staging area.</li>
<li><strong>Untracked Files:</strong> Files that Git is aware of but not yet tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Branch Information:</strong> The current branch you are working on.</li>
<li><strong>Commit Status:</strong> Whether there are commits to be pushed (in remote repository scenarios, not covered in this basic chapter).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="46-understanding-branches-git-branch">4.6 Understanding Branches (<code>git branch</code>)</h3>
<p>Branches are fundamental for managing different lines of development.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>List Branches:</strong> To see a list of branches in your repository, use:</p>
<p><code>bash
git branch</code></p>
<p>This command will list all branches. The currently active branch is indicated by an asterisk (<code>*</code>) and is often highlighted in green.  By default, Git usually creates a <code>master</code> (or <code>main</code>) branch upon initialization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="47-examining-commit-history-git-log">4.7 Examining Commit History (<code>git log</code>)</h3>
<p>To view the history of commits in your current branch, use the <code>git log</code> command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git log
</code></pre>
<p>This command displays a list of commits, starting with the most recent. For each commit, it shows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commit Hash (ID):</strong> A unique identifier for the commit.</li>
<li><strong>Author:</strong> The person who made the commit.</li>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> The date and time of the commit.</li>
<li><strong>Commit Message:</strong> The message associated with the commit.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exit the <code>git log</code> view, press <code>q</code>.</p>
<h3 id="48-checking-out-previous-commits-git-checkout">4.8 Checking Out Previous Commits (<code>git checkout</code>)</h3>
<p>Git allows you to travel back in time to previous commits using the <code>git checkout</code> command. This is useful for inspecting older versions of your code or reverting to a previous state.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get Commit Hash:</strong> Use <code>git log</code> to find the <strong>commit hash</strong> (the long alphanumeric string) of the commit you want to check out.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Checkout Commit:</strong> Use the <code>git checkout</code> command followed by the commit hash:</p>
<p><code>bash
git checkout &lt;commit-hash&gt;</code></p>
<p>Replace <code>&lt;commit-hash&gt;</code> with the actual commit hash you copied.</p>
<p>After checking out a commit, Git will put your repository in a "<strong>detached HEAD</strong>" state. This means you are no longer on a branch, but directly viewing a specific commit.  Changes made in this state are not automatically part of a branch unless explicitly created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Detached HEAD:</strong> A state in Git where the HEAD pointer is not pointing to a branch but directly to a commit. It's often entered when checking out a specific commit hash.
<strong>HEAD:</strong> A pointer in Git that usually refers to the latest commit on the current branch.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return to Branch:</strong> To return to your main branch (e.g., <code>master</code>), use:</p>
<p><code>bash
git checkout master</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="49-resetting-to-a-previous-commit-git-reset-hard">4.9 Resetting to a Previous Commit (<code>git reset --hard</code>)</h3>
<p>If you want to permanently discard commits and revert your branch to a previous state, you can use <code>git reset --hard</code>. <strong>Use this command with caution, as it permanently removes commits and changes.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get Commit Hash:</strong> Use <code>git log</code> to find the commit hash of the commit you want to reset to.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reset to Commit:</strong> Use the <code>git reset --hard</code> command followed by the commit hash:</p>
<p><code>bash
git reset --hard &lt;commit-hash&gt;</code></p>
<p>This command will move your branch pointer back to the specified commit, effectively removing all subsequent commits from your branch's history.  <strong>Changes in your working directory and staging area will also be discarded to match the state of the chosen commit.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="410-reverting-unstaged-changes-git-checkout-">4.10 Reverting Unstaged Changes (<code>git checkout -- .</code>)</h3>
<p>Sometimes you might make changes to your files in your working directory that you decide you don't want to keep. To discard these <strong>unstaged changes</strong> and revert your files back to the state of the last commit, you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout -- .
</code></pre>
<p>This command will revert all modified files in your working directory to their last committed state.  <strong>Be aware that this action is also irreversible for unstaged changes.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unstaged Changes:</strong> Modifications made to tracked files in your working directory that have not yet been added to the staging area using <code>git add</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5-conclusion-git-fundamentals">5. Conclusion: Git Fundamentals</h2>
<p>This chapter has covered the fundamental concepts of Git version control and introduced essential Git commands for managing your project's history.  Understanding repositories, branches, and commits, along with commands like <code>git init</code>, <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, <code>git status</code>, <code>git log</code>, <code>git checkout</code>, and <code>git reset</code>, provides a solid foundation for using Git effectively.</p>
<p>While there is much more to explore in Git, mastering these basics is crucial for any developer or anyone working with version-controlled projects.  Practice these commands and concepts to solidify your understanding and unlock the power of Git in your workflow.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-git-branching-for-collaborative-software-development">Understanding Git Branching for Collaborative Software Development</h1>
<p>This chapter introduces the concept of branching in Git, a powerful version control system widely used in software development. Branching allows developers to work on different features or bug fixes concurrently without disrupting the main codebase. This chapter will guide you through the fundamentals of Git branching, including creating, switching, merging, and managing branches, using practical examples drawn from a typical development workflow.</p>
<h2 id="1-introduction-to-branches">1. Introduction to Branches</h2>
<p>In Git, a branch is a parallel version of your repository. It essentially represents an independent line of development.  Think of it as a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Commit:</strong> In Git, a commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It represents a saved state of your project, including all files and their changes. Each commit has a unique identifier and contains information about the changes made, the author, and a timestamp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you initialize a Git repository, a default branch named <code>master</code> (or increasingly <code>main</code>) is automatically created. This branch typically represents the stable, production-ready version of your project.</p>
<h3 id="11-the-need-for-branching">1.1 The Need for Branching</h3>
<p>Imagine a scenario where you are developing a website. Your <code>master</code> branch contains the current stable version of your website. Now, you want to add a new feature.  Working directly on the <code>master</code> branch to develop this new feature carries risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instability:</strong>  The new feature might introduce bugs or instability, potentially breaking the live website if deployed prematurely.</li>
<li><strong>Interruption of Bug Fixes:</strong> If critical bugs are discovered in the stable version, you would need to interrupt your feature development to fix them directly in the <code>master</code> branch, disrupting your workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Branching provides a solution to these problems. It allows you to isolate new feature development or bug fixes from the stable <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<h3 id="12-feature-branches-a-practical-workflow">1.2 Feature Branches: A Practical Workflow</h3>
<p>A common and effective branching strategy involves using <strong>feature branches</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feature Branch:</strong> A feature branch is a branch created to develop a specific feature or implement a particular change in isolation from the main codebase (typically the <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> branch). This allows for focused development without risking the stability of the main branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how feature branches enhance the development workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel Development:</strong>  Developers can work on new features in their respective feature branches without affecting the <code>master</code> branch or each other's work.</li>
<li><strong>Stability of the Master Branch:</strong> The <code>master</code> branch remains stable and reflects the production-ready state of the project. Bug fixes can be applied directly to <code>master</code> and deployed without waiting for feature completion.</li>
<li><strong>Isolated Experimentation:</strong> Feature branches provide a safe space to experiment with new ideas or approaches without risking the main project.</li>
<li><strong>Code Review and Integration:</strong> Once a feature is complete, it can be reviewed and then merged back into the <code>master</code> branch, integrating the new functionality into the stable codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-creating-and-switching-branches">2. Creating and Switching Branches</h2>
<p>Let's learn how to create and switch between branches in Git using command-line instructions.</p>
<h3 id="21-creating-a-new-branch">2.1 Creating a New Branch</h3>
<p>To create a new branch, we use the <code>git checkout</code> command with the <code>-b</code> flag followed by the desired branch name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For example, to create a branch named <code>new-feature</code>, you would execute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout -b new-feature
</code></pre>
<p>This command does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Creates a new branch:</strong>  It creates a new branch named <code>new-feature</code> based on the current branch you are in (typically <code>master</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Switches to the new branch:</strong> It automatically switches your working directory to the newly created <code>new-feature</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note on Branch Naming:</strong> It's a good practice to use hyphens (-) to separate words in branch names (e.g., <code>new-feature</code>, <code>bug-fix-login</code>). This ensures compatibility and readability.</p>
<h3 id="22-listing-branches">2.2 Listing Branches</h3>
<p>To see a list of all branches in your repository and identify the currently active branch, use the <code>git branch</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git branch
</code></pre>
<p>This command will output a list of branches. The currently active branch will be marked with an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the line.</p>
<pre><code>* new-feature
  master
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>new-feature</code> is the currently active branch.</p>
<h3 id="23-understanding-branch-history">2.3 Understanding Branch History</h3>
<p>When you create a new branch, it initially contains all the commits from the branch it was created from. This means your new feature branch starts with the entire history of the <code>master</code> branch. The <code>HEAD</code> pointer in Git indicates the current commit of your active branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HEAD:</strong> In Git, HEAD is a pointer to the current branch's latest commit. It essentially indicates where you are in the repository's history and which commit is currently checked out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Running <code>git log</code> will show the commit history of the current branch. Initially, a newly created branch will share the same commit history as the branch it was branched from.</p>
<h2 id="3-working-on-a-feature-branch-adding-commits">3. Working on a Feature Branch: Adding Commits</h2>
<p>Let's illustrate the workflow of working on a feature branch. Suppose we are on the <code>new-feature</code> branch and we want to add a new stylesheet file named <code>style.css</code> to our project.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create the file:</strong> Create a new file named <code>style.css</code> in your project directory.</li>
<li><strong>Stage the changes:</strong> Use the <code>git add</code> command to stage the new file for commit.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   git add style.css</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>git add:</strong> This Git command stages changes in your working directory, preparing them to be included in the next commit.  It essentially adds files or modifications to the staging area, which is a temporary holding area for changes before they are permanently recorded in the repository's history.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Commit the changes:</strong> Use the <code>git commit -m</code> command to commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   git commit -m "CSS added"</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>git commit -m "message":</strong> This command records the staged changes in your repository's history, creating a new commit. The <code>-m</code> flag allows you to include a commit message directly in the command, describing the changes made in this commit.  Commit messages are crucial for understanding the history of changes in a project.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>View the commit history:</strong> Use <code>git log</code> to see the commit history of the <code>new-feature</code> branch. You will notice that the <code>HEAD</code> of the <code>new-feature</code> branch now points to the "CSS added" commit, while the <code>master</code> branch's <code>HEAD</code> remains at the previous commit. This demonstrates that commits made on the <code>new-feature</code> branch are isolated from the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4-switching-back-to-the-master-branch">4. Switching Back to the Master Branch</h2>
<p>To switch back to the <code>master</code> branch from the <code>new-feature</code> branch, use the <code>git checkout</code> command followed by the branch name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout master
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, for switching to the <code>master</code> branch specifically, you can use the shorthand command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git master
</code></pre>
<p>After switching back to the <code>master</code> branch, you will observe that the <code>style.css</code> file, which was added in the <code>new-feature</code> branch, is not present in your working directory. This is because the <code>master</code> branch does not yet contain the changes made in the <code>new-feature</code> branch.</p>
<h2 id="5-merging-branches-integrating-features">5. Merging Branches: Integrating Features</h2>
<p>Once the development of a feature in a feature branch is complete and tested, you typically want to integrate it back into the <code>master</code> branch. This process is called <strong>merging</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>git merge <branch_name>:</strong> This Git command integrates the changes from a specified branch (<code>&lt;branch_name&gt;</code>) into the currently active branch. It combines the commit history and file changes of both branches, effectively incorporating the development work from the merged branch into the current branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To merge the <code>new-feature</code> branch into the <code>master</code> branch:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Switch to the <code>master</code> branch:</strong> Ensure you are currently on the <code>master</code> branch using <code>git checkout master</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Execute the merge command:</strong> Use <code>git merge</code> followed by the name of the branch you want to merge (in this case, <code>new-feature</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   git merge new-feature</code></p>
<p>After a successful merge, the changes from the <code>new-feature</code> branch, including the addition of <code>style.css</code>, will now be incorporated into the <code>master</code> branch. If you run <code>git log</code> on the <code>master</code> branch, you will see that its <code>HEAD</code> now includes the commits from the merged <code>new-feature</code> branch.</p>
<h2 id="6-handling-merge-conflicts">6. Handling Merge Conflicts</h2>
<p>Sometimes, when merging branches, Git might encounter <strong>conflicts</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conflict (Merge Conflict):</strong> A merge conflict occurs in Git when changes made in different branches overlap in the same lines of a file, and Git cannot automatically determine which changes to incorporate during a merge. This typically happens when the same lines of code are modified differently in the branches being merged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conflicts usually arise when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Same lines modified:</strong>  The same lines in a file have been modified in both the branch being merged and the current branch.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion vs. Modification:</strong> A file was modified in one branch and deleted in another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's illustrate a conflict scenario. Suppose:</p>
<ol>
<li>We create a new feature branch named <code>new-feature-2</code>.</li>
<li>In <code>new-feature-2</code>, we modify the <code>index.html</code> file, changing "hello" to "goodbye". We commit this change.</li>
<li>We switch back to the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
<li>In <code>master</code>, we also modify the <em>same</em> line in <code>index.html</code>, changing "hello" to "bye". We commit this change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if we try to merge <code>new-feature-2</code> into <code>master</code> while on the <code>master</code> branch (<code>git merge new-feature-2</code>), Git will detect a conflict.</p>
<h3 id="61-resolving-conflicts">6.1 Resolving Conflicts</h3>
<p>When a conflict occurs, Git will:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pause the merge process.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mark the conflicted file:</strong>  It will add special conflict markers in the conflicted file to highlight the conflicting sections from both branches.</li>
</ol>
<p>```html
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
   bye
   =======
   goodbye</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>new-feature-2
   ```</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code>:  Marks the beginning of the conflicting section from the current branch (<code>master</code> in this case).</li>
<li><code>=======</code>: Separates the changes from the current branch and the branch being merged (<code>new-feature-2</code>).</li>
<li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new-feature-2</code>: Marks the end of the conflicting section from the <code>new-feature-2</code> branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>To resolve a conflict:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open the conflicted file:</strong> Open <code>index.html</code> in a text editor.</li>
<li><strong>Manually edit the file:</strong> Examine the conflict markers and decide which version of the code to keep or how to combine them. In our example, if we want to keep "goodbye", we would edit the file to:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>html
   goodbye</code></p>
<p>Remove the conflict markers (<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code>, <code>=======</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new-feature-2</code>) and the unwanted code.
3. <strong>Stage the resolved file:</strong> After editing, stage the resolved file using <code>git add index.html</code>.
4. <strong>Complete the merge:</strong> Commit the resolved merge using <code>git commit -m "Merge resolved"</code>. Git will recognize that the conflict has been resolved and complete the merge process.</p>
<h2 id="7-deleting-branches">7. Deleting Branches</h2>
<p>Once a feature branch has been successfully merged into the <code>master</code> branch and is no longer needed, you can delete it. To delete a branch, use the <code>git branch -D</code> command followed by the branch name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git branch -D &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For example, to delete the <code>new-feature</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git branch -D new-feature
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Be careful when deleting branches, especially with the <code>-D</code> flag (uppercase D), as it forcefully deletes the branch even if it hasn't been merged. Ensure that the branch is no longer required before deleting it.  It's generally safer to use <code>-d</code> (lowercase d) first, which will prevent deletion if the branch hasn't been merged.</p>
<h2 id="8-summary-of-key-git-branch-commands">8. Summary of Key Git Branch Commands</h2>
<p>Here is a summary of the Git commands discussed in this chapter:</p>
<p><strong>Initialization and Status:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>git init</code>: Initializes a new Git repository.</li>
<li><code>git status</code>: Shows the current status of your Git repository, including staged and unstaged changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code> or <code>git add .</code>: Stages changes for commit. <code>git add .</code> stages all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories.</li>
<li><code>git commit -m "&lt;message&gt;"</code>: Creates a new commit with the staged changes and a commit message.</li>
<li><code>git log</code>: Displays the commit history of the current branch.</li>
<li><code>git checkout &lt;commit_id&gt;</code>: Checks out a specific commit, allowing you to view the repository at that point in time.</li>
<li><code>git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;</code>: Discards unstaged changes in a specific file, reverting it to the last commit.</li>
<li><code>git reset --hard &lt;commit_id&gt;</code>: Resets the current branch to a specific commit, discarding all commits after that commit. <strong>Use with caution as it can lead to data loss.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Branches:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>git branch</code>: Lists all branches in the repository.</li>
<li><code>git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> or <code>git &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> (for master/main): Switches to an existing branch.</li>
<li><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>: Creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
<li><code>git merge &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.</li>
<li><code>git branch -D &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>: Forcefully deletes a branch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-further-learning">9. Further Learning</h2>
<p>To deepen your understanding of Git and branching, it is highly recommended to explore the official Git documentation. The "Git Basics - Working with Branches" chapter in the Pro Git book is an excellent resource for further learning and practice:</p>
