<p><strong>Angular:</strong> A comprehensive, platform-agnostic JavaScript framework for building complex web applications, particularly single-page applications. It is developed and maintained by Google.</p>
<p><strong>Backend:</strong> The server-side of an application, responsible for data storage, processing, and logic. It interacts with the frontend to deliver the functionality of the application.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong>  The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.</p>
<p><strong>Request-Response Cycle:</strong> A fundamental communication pattern in client-server architecture, particularly on the web. A client sends a request to a server, and the server processes the request and sends back a response to the client.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Methods:</strong> Verbs that define the type of action a client wants to perform when making a request to a server. Common HTTP methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).</p>
<p><strong>Status Codes:</strong> Three-digit codes returned by a server in response to an HTTP request, indicating the outcome of the request. For example, 200 OK indicates success, 404 Not Found indicates the requested resource was not found, and 500 Internal Server Error indicates a server-side error.</p>
<p><strong>Header Properties:</strong>  Metadata included in HTTP requests and responses, providing additional information about the message being transmitted. Headers can specify content type, encoding, authorization details, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Body Properties:</strong> The data payload of an HTTP request or response, containing the actual content being transmitted. For example, in a POST request, the body might contain the data being submitted to the server.</p>
<p><strong>Node.js:</strong> A JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed server-side. It enables developers to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development.</p>
<p><strong>Express:</strong> A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> A high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and scripting.</p>
<p><strong>Django:</strong> A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern.</p>
<p><strong>PHP:</strong> A widely-used, general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development. It can be embedded into HTML and is often used for creating dynamic web pages.</p>
<p><strong>Laravel:</strong> A popular PHP web framework known for its elegant syntax, robust features, and developer-friendly environment. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> The set of rules that define the structure of a programming language. It dictates how code must be written to be correctly interpreted and executed by a computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, understanding fundamentals transcends specific tools and languages.  It allows you to adapt to new technologies quickly, troubleshoot effectively, and approach programming challenges with a deeper level of comprehension.
