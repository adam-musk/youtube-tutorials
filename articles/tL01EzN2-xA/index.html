<h2 id="introduction-to-encore">Introduction to Encore</h2>
<p>In today's fast-paced digital world, efficient backend development is crucial for building robust and scalable applications.  This chapter introduces Encore, a novel backend development platform designed to streamline the entire development lifecycle, from local setup and testing to cloud deployment and operations.  Encore aims to abstract away much of the complexity traditionally associated with backend infrastructure and DevOps, allowing developers to focus primarily on writing application logic.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-encore">What is Encore?</h3>
<p>Encore is described as more than just a <strong>backend framework</strong>. It is a comprehensive <strong>development platform</strong> that offers a complete toolset tailored for backend development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Backend framework:</strong> A software framework designed to simplify the development of the server-side components of web applications, APIs, and mobile backends. These frameworks typically provide tools and libraries for handling routing, database interactions, and other server-side functionalities.</p>
<p><strong>Development platform:</strong> A suite of tools and services designed to support the complete software development lifecycle. This can include tools for coding, testing, debugging, deployment, and management of applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Encore distinguishes itself by handling everything from local development and testing environments to cloud infrastructure management and <strong>DevOps</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DevOps:</strong> A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key aspect of Encore is its use of <strong>infrastructure as code</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Infrastructure as code (IaC):</strong>  The practice of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This approach allows for automation and version control of infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach significantly reduces the amount of manual configuration and <strong>boilerplate</strong> code typically required for cloud infrastructure setup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Boilerplate code:</strong> Sections of code that are repeated in many contexts with little to no alteration. It is often used to set up basic functionalities or configurations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="core-features-of-encore">Core Features of Encore</h3>
<p>Encore boasts a range of features designed to enhance developer productivity and application performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplified Infrastructure:</strong> With a single line of code, developers can spin up a <strong>Docker container</strong> containing a fully functional <strong>Postgres database</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker container:</strong> A standardized unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.</p>
<p><strong>Postgres database:</strong> An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability, feature robustness, and extensibility.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Express:</strong> A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript-based backend frameworks:</strong> Backend frameworks built using the JavaScript programming language, commonly used with Node.js for server-side development.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="encore-ts-and-encore-go">Encore TS and Encore Go</h2>
<h3 id="two-flavors-of-encore">Two Flavors of Encore</h3>
<p>Encore offers two primary flavors to cater to different developer preferences and project requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Encore TS:</strong> A <strong>TypeScript</strong> backend framework. TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, adds static typing, which enhances code maintainability and reduces runtime errors. This is the version primarily discussed and used in the context of the original transcript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TypeScript:</strong> A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. TypeScript is often preferred for large projects due to its enhanced code organization and error detection capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encore Go:</strong> A <strong>Go</strong> backend framework. Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is known for its efficiency, concurrency features, and suitability for building scalable and high-performance applications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Go:</strong>  Also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and built-in concurrency, making it well-suited for backend development and system programming.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Encore TS and Encore Go are designed to build robust and type-safe applications, sharing largely the same feature set, differing mainly in the underlying programming language.</p>
<h3 id="performance-benchmarks">Performance Benchmarks</h3>
<p>Encore emphasizes performance as a key differentiator. While acknowledging that performance can vary based on specific project needs, Encore provides benchmark data indicating significant speed advantages compared to other popular frameworks. According to their benchmarks, Encore outperforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Express:</strong>  Claiming to be up to nine times faster.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fastify:</strong>  Reportedly twice as fast as Fastify.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fastify:</strong> A web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with a focus on speed and low overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bun JS:</strong>  Even surpassing the performance of Bun JS, a relatively new JavaScript runtime environment known for its speed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bun JS:</strong> A fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager, designed to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This performance boost is attributed, in part, to Encore's Rust runtime, which is explored further in subsequent sections.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-encore">Key Features of Encore</h2>
<h3 id="built-in-type-validation">Built-in Type Validation</h3>
<p>Encore's type validation system is a core feature designed for both developer convenience and application security. It operates in a <strong>declarative</strong> manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Declarative:</strong> A programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. In the context of type validation, it means defining the expected data types and structures in a way that the system automatically enforces them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This declarative approach enables Encore to automatically parse and validate incoming requests, ensuring they conform to the defined schema. This automated validation happens before the request even reaches the application's JavaScript code layer, providing a robust layer of protection against attacks and data inconsistencies. This proactive validation removes the need for manual validation boilerplate, streamlining development and enhancing security.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-as-code-simplified-devops">Infrastructure as Code: Simplified DevOps</h3>
<p>One of the most compelling aspects of Encore is its <strong>infrastructure as code</strong> approach, which significantly simplifies <strong>DevOps</strong> tasks.  For developers accustomed to the complexities of deploying applications to cloud platforms like AWS using frameworks like Express, Encore offers a streamlined alternative.</p>
<p>Traditionally, deploying an Express application often involves intricate configurations and substantial boilerplate to set up cloud infrastructure. Encore is specifically architected for building <strong>cloud-native applications</strong>, abstracting away much of this infrastructure complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cloud-native applications:</strong> Applications designed and built to take full advantage of cloud computing architectures. They are typically composed of microservices, packaged in containers, and dynamically orchestrated to optimize scalability, resilience, and agility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This abstraction allows developers to concentrate more on core business logic rather than getting bogged down in infrastructure details.  Encore simplifies common infrastructure tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Databases:</strong> Creating a Postgres database is reduced to a single line of code.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Messaging:</strong> Setting up <strong>publish-subscribe topics</strong> for asynchronous communication is similarly straightforward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Publish-subscribe topics:</strong> A messaging pattern where publishers send messages to a topic, and subscribers who are interested in that topic receive the messages. This enables decoupled communication between different parts of an application.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scheduled Tasks:</strong> Defining <strong>cron jobs</strong> for scheduled tasks becomes simple and declarative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cron jobs:</strong> Scheduled tasks that run automatically at specified intervals. They are commonly used for automating routine operations, such as backups, maintenance, or sending periodic reports.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Future Integrations:</strong>  Encore plans to integrate with services like <strong>Redis</strong> for caching and data management in the near future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Redis:</strong> An open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is known for its high performance and versatility.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Encore achieves this simplification in local development environments by leveraging <strong>Docker</strong>.  By running a <strong>migration file</strong>, Encore automatically sets up a Docker container with the necessary database and other specified infrastructure components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Migration file:</strong> A script that defines changes to a database schema. Migration files are used to track and apply database schema updates in a controlled and versioned manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developers only need to have Docker installed; Encore handles the creation and management of containers automatically.  Deployment to the cloud is equally streamlined, accomplished with a single command, further emphasizing Encore's commitment to simplifying the DevOps workflow.</p>
<h2 id="core-components">Core Components</h2>
<h3 id="high-performance-rust-runtime">High-Performance Rust Runtime</h3>
<p>Encore's architecture comprises two key parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>TypeScript/Go SDK:</strong>  A Software Development Kit (<strong>SDK</strong>) in either TypeScript or Go, used for building backend services and APIs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SDK (Software Development Kit):</strong> A set of software development tools that allows the creation of applications for a certain software package, software framework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating system, or similar development platform.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High-Performance Rust Runtime:</strong> A multi-threaded runtime environment written in Rust. This runtime is crucial for Encore's performance advantages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This Rust runtime is designed to integrate seamlessly with the <strong>Node.js runtime</strong> for executing JavaScript code, ensuring 100% compatibility with the <strong>Node.js ecosystem</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Node.js runtime:</strong> A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code server-side. Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is popular for building scalable network applications.</p>
<p><strong>Node.js ecosystem:</strong> The collection of libraries, frameworks, tools, and community resources available for Node.js development. It is known for its vast and active community support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of Rust provides a significant performance boost compared to the traditional Node.js runtime. Benchmarks indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throughput Increase:</strong> Throughput is increased by up to seven times.</li>
<li><strong>Latency Reduction:</strong> Response latency is reduced by as much as 85%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, Encore boasts zero <strong>npm dependencies</strong>, which also contributes to improved performance and enhanced security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>npm dependencies:</strong> External libraries or packages that a Node.js project relies on, managed by npm (Node Package Manager). Reducing dependencies can improve performance and security by minimizing the codebase and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Node.js initializes the Rust runtime.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request Handling:</strong> The Rust runtime listens for incoming requests, parsing and validating them against the <strong>API schema</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>API schema:</strong> A formal specification that defines the structure and constraints of an API, including the data types, request formats, and response formats.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code Execution:</strong> Valid requests are passed to the application code running in Node.js.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> When the application interacts with infrastructure resources (e.g., database queries), these operations are offloaded to the Rust runtime for faster execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>This architecture allows the single-threaded <strong>Node.js event loop</strong> to focus on executing business logic, while resource-intensive tasks are handled concurrently by Encore's multi-threaded Rust runtime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Node.js event loop:</strong> A single-threaded loop in Node.js that handles asynchronous operations. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-encore">Getting Started with Encore</h2>
<h3 id="encore-cloud-account">Encore Cloud Account</h3>
<p>To fully leverage Encore's capabilities, creating an Encore <strong>cloud account</strong> is recommended.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cloud account:</strong> An account with a cloud service provider that grants access to cloud computing resources and services. In the context of Encore, it provides access to Encore's cloud platform for deployment and management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon installing Encore and creating a new project, users are prompted to create a cloud account. This account is essential for utilizing Encore's built-in infrastructure and one-command deployment features.

</ul>
<p>The dashboard effectively acts as a built-in <strong>Postman</strong>-like tool, allowing developers to test API endpoints directly without needing external applications.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-basic-endpoint">Creating a Basic Endpoint</h3>
<p>Encore simplifies the creation of API endpoints.  Endpoints are typically organized within a folder structure that mirrors the desired API URL structure.  For example, to create an endpoint at <code>/greeting</code>, a folder named <code>greeting</code> would be created. Within this folder, a file (e.g., <code>greeting.ts</code>) would define the endpoint logic.</p>
<p>To define an endpoint, the <code>API</code> function is imported from <code>encore.dev/api</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">import { API } from 'encore.dev/api';
</code></pre>
<p>An endpoint is then defined by exporting a function and assigning it to <code>API()</code>, configuring the endpoint's properties within the <code>API()</code> call.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">export const greeting = API({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/greeting',
    expose: true,
}, async () =&gt; {
    // Endpoint logic here
});
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>method:</strong> Specifies the HTTP <strong>method</strong> for the endpoint (e.g., 'GET', 'POST').</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Method (HTTP method):</strong>  Indicates the desired action to be performed for a given resource in an HTTP request. Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (create new data), PUT (update existing data), and DELETE (remove data).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>path:</strong> Defines the URL <strong>path</strong> for the endpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Path (URL path):</strong> The part of a URL that identifies a specific resource within a web server.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>expose:</strong> A boolean value indicating whether the endpoint should be publicly <strong>exposed</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Expose:</strong> To make an API endpoint publicly accessible over the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second argument to <code>API()</code> is an <strong>async function</strong> that contains the endpoint's business logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Async function:</strong> A function that allows asynchronous operations using the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords, enabling non-blocking execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This function should return a <strong>Promise</strong> that resolves to the desired response type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TypeScript Interfaces for Type Safety:</strong></p>
<p>To leverage TypeScript's type safety, interfaces are often defined to specify the structure of request and response data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">interface Response {
    data: string;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The endpoint function is then typed to return a <code>Promise</code> of the defined response interface.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">async (): Promise&lt;Response&gt; =&gt; {
    return { data: 'Hello, world!' };
}
</code></pre>
<p>After saving the endpoint file, the Encore development server may need to be restarted (<code>encore run</code>) for the new endpoint to be registered and visible in the dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="handling-path-parameters">Handling Path Parameters</h3>
<p>To capture dynamic segments in the URL path, <strong>path parameters</strong> are used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Path parameters:</strong>  Dynamic segments within a URL path that are used to identify specific resources. They are typically denoted by colons in route definitions (e.g., <code>/users/:userId</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Path parameters are defined in the <code>path</code> property using a colon prefix (e.g., <code>/greeting/:name</code>).  The parameter name (e.g., <code>name</code>) is then accessible as an argument to the endpoint function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">export const greeting = API({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/greeting/:name',
    expose: true,
}, async ({ name }: { name: string }): Promise&lt;Response&gt; =&gt; {
    return { data: `Hello, ${name}!` };
});
</code></pre>
<h3 id="handling-query-parameters">Handling Query Parameters</h3>
<p><strong>Query parameters</strong> are used to pass optional data to an endpoint via the URL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Query parameters:</strong>  Key-value pairs appended to the end of a URL after a question mark (?). They are used to pass additional information to the server, often for filtering, sorting, or pagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To access query parameters, the <code>query</code> function is imported from <code>encore.dev/api</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">import { API, query } from 'encore.dev/api';
</code></pre>
<p>An interface is defined to specify the expected query parameters, using <code>query&lt;string&gt;</code> to indicate that the <code>filter</code> query parameter is expected to be a string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">interface SearchParams {
    filter: query&lt;string&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The endpoint function is then defined to accept the query parameters interface using <strong>generics</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Generics:</strong>  A feature in programming languages that allows types to be parameters to type definitions. Generics enable writing code that can work with different types while maintaining type safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">export const search = API&lt;SearchParams, SearchResponse&gt;({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/greeting/search',
    expose: true,
}, async ({ filter }): Promise&lt;SearchResponse&gt; =&gt; {
    return { matches: `Matched: ${filter}` };
});
</code></pre>
<p>The query parameters are then accessible within the endpoint function's arguments. The Encore dashboard provides input fields for specifying query parameter values when testing endpoints.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-url-shortener-service">Building a URL Shortener Service</h2>
<h3 id="endpoint-1-shortening-a-url-post-url">Endpoint 1: Shortening a URL (POST /url)</h3>
<p>To build a URL shortener service, the first endpoint required is one that accepts a long URL and returns a shortened URL. This endpoint will use the POST method at the <code>/url</code> path.</p>
<p><strong>Functionality:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Receive Long URL:</strong> The endpoint receives a long URL in the request body.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generate Short ID:</strong> It generates a unique short ID for the URL. <strong>Random bytes</strong> from the <strong>crypto</strong> module are used to create a cryptographically secure random ID.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Random bytes:</strong>  A sequence of bytes generated randomly or pseudo-randomly, often used for cryptographic purposes, such as generating unique IDs or keys.</p>
<p><strong>crypto:</strong> A Node.js core module that provides cryptographic functionality, including generating random numbers, hashing, and encryption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ID is then encoded into a <strong>base64 URL</strong> string for URL-safe characters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Base64 URL:</strong> A URL-safe variant of Base64 encoding, which is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. Base64 URL encoding replaces characters that are not URL-safe with URL-safe alternatives.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Store in Database:</strong> The long URL and its corresponding short ID are stored in a <strong>database schema</strong>. A <strong>migration file</strong> is used to define the database schema.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Database schema:</strong> The structure of a database, defining tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Migration file:</strong> A script that defines changes to a database schema. Migration files are used to track and apply database schema updates in a controlled and versioned manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Encore simplifies database operations through the <strong>SQL database utility</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SQL database utility:</strong> A feature provided by Encore that simplifies interaction with SQL databases, including setup, schema migration, and querying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Encore automatically sets up a <strong>Docker container</strong> running a Postgres database when a database resource is defined in the code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker container:</strong> A standardized unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong>database instance</strong> is created using <code>SQLDatabase</code> from <code>encore.storage.sqldb</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Database instance:</strong> A running instance of a database server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>migrations</code> option points to the directory containing <strong>migration files</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>

    await db.exec`
        INSERT INTO url (id, original_url)
        VALUES (${id}, ${url})
    `;

    return { id, url };

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Migration File (<code>migrations/encore_create_url_tables.up.sql</code>):</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TABLE url (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    original_url TEXT NOT NULL
);
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>CREATE TABLE:</strong> SQL command to create a new table named <code>url</code>.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>id TEXT PRIMARY KEY:</strong> Defines a column named <code>id</code> of type TEXT as the <strong>primary key</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Primary key:</strong> A column or set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Primary keys enforce uniqueness and are used for efficient data retrieval.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>original_url TEXT NOT NULL:</strong> Defines a column named <code>original_url</code> of type TEXT that <strong>cannot be null</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOT NULL:</strong> A constraint in database schema design that ensures a column cannot contain null values.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="endpoint-2-redirecting-with-short-id-get-urlid">Endpoint 2: Redirecting with Short ID (GET /url/:id)</h3>
<p>The second endpoint handles redirection from a short URL to the original long URL. This endpoint uses the GET method at the <code>/url/:id</code> path, where <code>:id</code> is the short ID.</p>
<p><strong>Functionality:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Receive Short ID:</strong> The endpoint receives the short ID as a path parameter.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieve Long URL:</strong> It queries the database to retrieve the original long URL associated with the provided short ID using the <code>queryRow</code> method.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>queryRow method:</strong> A method provided by Encore's SQL database utility to execute a SQL query and retrieve a single row of results.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handle Not Found:</strong> If no matching short ID is found in the database, an <strong>API error</strong> with a "not found" status is thrown using <code>APIError.notFound()</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>API error:</strong> An error response returned by an API to indicate that something went wrong during request processing.</p>
<p><strong>Not found (404):</strong> An HTTP status code indicating that the requested resource could not be found on the server.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return Long URL:</strong> If a matching short ID is found, the endpoint returns the corresponding long URL.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Code Implementation:</strong></p>

<h2 id="deployment-and-conclusion">Deployment and Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="deployment-to-encore-cloud">Deployment to Encore Cloud</h3>
<p>Deploying an Encore application to the Encore Cloud platform is remarkably simple. After initializing a Git repository and committing the code, deployment is achieved with a single <strong>Git</strong> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Git:</strong> A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git push encore
</code></pre>
<p>This command triggers a deployment process, pushing the application code to Encore's <strong>staging environment</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Staging environment:</strong> A deployment environment that mirrors the production environment and is used for testing and quality assurance before deploying to production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deployment status can be monitored on the Encore Cloud dashboard, accessible via <code>app.encore.dev</code>. The dashboard displays deployment logs and progress.</p>
<h3 id="staging-environment">Staging Environment</h3>
<p>Once deployed, the application is accessible in the <strong>staging environment</strong>. Encore provides a staging URL for testing and verification.  The staging environment allows developers to test the application in a cloud environment that closely resembles the <strong>production environment</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Production environment:</strong> The live environment where the application is deployed and accessible to end-users.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="production-deployment">Production Deployment</h3>
<p>While the transcript primarily focuses on staging deployment, Encore also supports deployment to <strong>production environments</strong>.  Details on production deployment, including scaling and <strong>pricing structure</strong>, can be found in Encore's official documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Production environment:</strong> The live environment where the application is deployed and accessible to end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing structure:</strong> The cost model for using a service or platform, typically outlining different pricing tiers and features.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="further-exploration">Further Exploration</h3>
