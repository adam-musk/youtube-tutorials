<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Technology encompasses a vast array of fields, and within programming, the sheer number of languages available can be daunting, particularly for beginners. This chapter provides a crash course on programming languages, exploring many modern options, their strengths, and underlying concepts. We will delve into the distinctions between low-level and high-level languages, compiled versus interpreted languages, and statically typed versus dynamically typed languages. This overview aims to provide valuable insights for newcomers and experienced programmers alike who are considering learning a new language.</p>
<h2 id="levels-of-programming-languages-low-level-vs-high-level">Levels of Programming Languages: Low-Level vs. High-Level</h2>
<p>When discussing the "level" of a programming language, we are essentially comparing how closely the code we write is to what the computer's hardware, specifically the Central Processing Unit (CPU), understands. Computers do not directly understand languages like JavaScript, C#, or Java. These languages must be translated into a format that the CPU can process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> The primary component of a computer that processes instructions and performs calculations. It is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the "level" of a language refers to its proximity to the hardware and the degree of abstraction present.</p>
<h3 id="machine-language-the-lowest-level">Machine Language: The Lowest Level</h3>
<p>At the very bottom, closest to the hardware, is <strong>machine language</strong>, also known as <strong>machine code</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Machine Language (Machine Code):</strong> The most fundamental level of programming language, consisting of binary code (sequences of 0s and 1s) that directly instructs a computer's CPU.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Machine code is the absolute lowest level of code.</li>
<li>It comprises instructions that directly control the CPU.</li>
<li>These instructions are purely numeric, represented as binary (0s and 1s).</li>
<li>While binary is machine-readable, it is difficult for humans. Machine code can also be represented in <strong>hexadecimal</strong>, a base-16 number system, for improved human readability.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hexadecimal:</strong> A base-16 number system used in computing as a more human-readable way to represent binary data. It uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F to represent values.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Machines process only binary because it directly corresponds to electrical states (on or off).</li>
</ul>
<p>Programmers no longer write machine code directly due to its tedious and error-prone nature.</p>
<h3 id="assembly-language-a-step-above-machine-code">Assembly Language: A Step Above Machine Code</h3>
<p>The next level up is <strong>assembly language (ASM)</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Assembly Language:</strong> A low-level programming language that uses symbolic representations (mnemonics) for machine instructions. It provides a more human-readable alternative to machine code while still offering direct hardware control.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Assembly language uses numbers, symbols, and abbreviations instead of just 0s and 1s.</li>
<li>Assembly code is not compiled in the same way as higher-level languages. Instead, it is <strong>assembled</strong> into executable machine code by an <strong>assembler</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Assembler:</strong> A program that translates assembly language code into machine code that can be directly executed by a computer's CPU.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assembling</strong> is a simpler process compared to <strong>compiling</strong>, which is used for higher-level languages.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Compiling:</strong> The process of translating source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or bytecode that can be executed by a computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Learning assembly language provides valuable insight into how software interacts with the CPU and hardware.</li>
<li>Today, assembly language is primarily used for developing <strong>firmware</strong> and software for <strong>embedded systems</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Firmware:</strong>  A type of software that is embedded into hardware devices, providing low-level control and instructions for the device's operation. It is often stored in non-volatile memory like ROM or flash memory.</p>
<p><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Specialized computer systems designed to perform specific tasks within a larger device or system. Examples include microcontrollers in appliances, cars, and industrial equipment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="general-purpose-languages-bridging-the-gap">General-Purpose Languages: Bridging the Gap</h3>
<p>Moving further up, we encounter <strong>general-purpose languages</strong> like C and C++.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General-Purpose Language:</strong> A programming language designed to be versatile and applicable to a wide range of programming tasks, rather than being specialized for a particular domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In some contexts, especially when compared to machine and assembly language, these are referred to as "high-level languages."</li>
<li>However, relative to languages like Python or Java, they are considered "lower-level."</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="c-the-foundation">C: The Foundation</h4>
<p>C is considered the lowest-level <strong>general-purpose language</strong>, with only assembly and machine code being lower.</p>
<ul>
<li>Created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, derived from the language "B."</li>
<li>Used to develop the UNIX operating system.</li>
<li>C is a <strong>procedural language</strong>, contrasting with <strong>object-oriented</strong> languages.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procedural Language:</strong> A programming paradigm that focuses on structuring programs as a sequence of procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. Code is organized into blocks of instructions that are executed in a linear fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Object-Oriented Language:</strong> A programming paradigm that organizes code around "objects," which are instances of "classes." Objects encapsulate data (properties) and behavior (methods), promoting modularity, reusability, and abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Being lower-level, C requires manual management of hardware resources like <strong>memory allocation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Memory Allocation:</strong> The process of reserving a portion of a computer's memory to store data or instructions during program execution. In lower-level languages, programmers often have manual control over this process.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>C is powerful and versatile, used for:<ul>
<li>Operating systems (e.g., Windows kernel)</li>
<li>Compilers for other languages</li>
<li>Device drivers</li>
<li>Database systems</li>
<li>Various powerful programs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C is a <strong>compiled language</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compiled-vs-interpreted-languages">Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages</h4>
<p>Before proceeding, it's essential to understand the difference between <strong>compiled</strong> and <strong>interpreted languages</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compiled Languages:</strong> Require a <strong>compiler</strong> to translate the source code into machine code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Compiler:</strong> A software tool that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or bytecode before program execution. The compiled code is then executed directly by the computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>*   The compiler processes the code into machine-understandable instructions.
*   The resulting compiled program is not human-readable and is executed directly by the CPU.
*   Lower-level compiled languages like C often require manual memory management, offering greater hardware control but increased complexity.
*   Compiled languages generally result in faster runtime execution due to direct machine code execution.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpreted Languages:</strong> Do not directly compile to machine code. An <strong>interpreter</strong> is used to execute the code line by line.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpreter:</strong> A software tool that executes source code line by line at runtime. It reads and executes instructions directly, without a separate compilation step into machine code.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>*   The source code is processed through an interpreter during execution.
*   Languages like Python and Ruby are often first compiled into **bytecode**, an intermediate form, before being executed by a **virtual machine**.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bytecode:</strong> An intermediate form of code that is created after the source code is compiled but before it is executed by a virtual machine. It is platform-independent and designed to be executed by an interpreter or virtual machine.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Machine:</strong> A software environment that emulates a computer system, allowing programs written in bytecode or other intermediate forms to run on different platforms. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Python Virtual Machine (PVM) are examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>*   While technically having a compilation step to bytecode, these are generally categorized as **interpreted or scripting languages**.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scripting Language:</strong> Often used interchangeably with "interpreted language," referring to languages designed for automating tasks, controlling applications, and creating dynamic content. They are typically higher-level and easier to use than compiled languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>*   Interpreted languages are typically easier to work with and enable faster code writing (faster write time).
*   However, they introduce more abstraction, and the execution process can be slower at runtime compared to compiled languages because of the interpretation step.
</code></pre>
<p>The choice between compiled and interpreted languages involves trade-offs, balancing development speed and ease with runtime performance.</p>
<h4 id="c-object-oriented-powerhouse">C++: Object-Oriented Powerhouse</h4>
<p>C++ was created in the 1980s as a <strong>superset</strong> of C, meaning it includes all of C's features and adds more tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Superset:</strong> In programming languages, a language A is a superset of language B if it includes all features of B and adds additional features. C++ is a superset of C.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>C++ is <strong>object-oriented</strong>, introducing the concept of objects and classes.</li>
<li>Like C, C++ does not have <strong>garbage collection</strong>, requiring manual memory management.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Garbage Collection:</strong> An automatic memory management process in some programming languages that reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. This relieves programmers from manually freeing memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>C++ is incredibly powerful, used for:<ul>
<li>AAA gaming titles</li>
<li>Operating systems</li>
<li>Virtual Reality (VR)</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>Scientific computing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rust-modern-performance-and-safety">Rust: Modern Performance and Safety</h4>
<p>Rust is a relatively newer language emphasizing both low-level control and high performance, while also prioritizing memory safety.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides higher-level capabilities than C and C++ but with memory safety features to reduce errors.</li>
<li>Does not have garbage collection, but offers built-in memory safety mechanisms.</li>
<li>Rust's applications include:<ul>
<li>Game engines</li>
<li>Operating systems</li>
<li>Browser components</li>
<li>VR applications</li>
<li>Web servers and back-end web development (APIs, microservices) using frameworks like Rocket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rust is gaining traction in <strong>WebAssembly (Wasm)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WebAssembly (Wasm):</strong> A binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed for high performance in web browsers, enabling near-native speed execution of code written in languages like C++, Rust, and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>*   Wasm is a new type of bytecode for modern browsers, offering significantly higher performance than JavaScript.
*   Languages like C++ and Rust can be compiled to Wasm.
*   Wasm has significant potential for gaming and video tools within browsers.

<h2 id="higher-level-interpreted-languages-ease-of-use-and-rapid-development">Higher-Level, Interpreted Languages: Ease of Use and Rapid Development</h2>
<p>Moving to even higher-level languages, many of which are interpreted, sacrifices some runtime speed for increased ease of use and faster development. These are particularly popular in web development.</p>
<h3 id="java-write-once-run-anywhere">Java: Write Once, Run Anywhere</h3>
<p>Java is a high-level, <strong>class-based</strong>, <strong>object-oriented programming language</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Class-Based:</strong> Refers to object-oriented programming languages where objects are created as instances of classes, which define the structure and behavior of objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything in Java is an object or part of an object, defined by <strong>classes</strong>.</li>
<li>Classes contain <strong>variables</strong> (properties) and <strong>functions</strong> (methods).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Properties (Variables):</strong> In object-oriented programming, properties, also known as attributes or fields, are data associated with an object that describe its state.</p>
<p><strong>Methods (Functions):</strong> In object-oriented programming, methods, also known as functions or operations, are actions or behaviors that an object can perform.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability.</li>
<li>Compiled Java code can run on any platform with Java support without recompilation, thanks to the <strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>JVM (Java Virtual Machine):</strong> A virtual machine that enables Java bytecode to run on various operating systems. It provides a platform-independent runtime environment for Java applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Java is compiled into bytecode for the JVM.</li>
<li>Applications of Java include:<ul>
<li>Desktop applications (Graphical User Interface - GUI)</li>
<li>Enterprise applications</li>
<li>Web servers and APIs</li>
<li>Android mobile app development</li>
<li>Large-scale business applications (used by companies like Spotify, LinkedIn, Amazon)</li>
<li>Games (e.g., Minecraft)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Java is <strong>statically typed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="static-vs-dynamic-typing">Static vs. Dynamic Typing</h4>
<p><strong>Static typing</strong> and <strong>dynamic typing</strong> are important distinctions in programming languages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statically Typed Languages:</strong> Type checking is performed at compile time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Statically Typed:</strong> A programming language paradigm where the data type of variables is checked and enforced at compile time. This requires explicit declaration of variable types in the code, enhancing code reliability and catching type-related errors early.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>*   Data types must be explicitly defined in the code for variables and function returns (e.g., specifying a variable as a string).
*   Once a type is assigned, it cannot change (e.g., a string cannot become a boolean).
*   Languages discussed so far (C, C++, Rust, Java, C#) are statically typed.
*   Statically typed languages can be more robust and less prone to type-related errors.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamically Typed Languages:</strong> Type checking is done at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dynamically Typed:</strong> A programming language paradigm where data types of variables are checked and enforced during program execution (runtime), not at compile time. Variable types are inferred automatically, offering flexibility but potentially leading to runtime type errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>*   Types are not explicitly defined; the language infers the type automatically at runtime.
*   Examples include JavaScript and Python (discussed later).
*   Dynamically typed languages require less code related to type declarations, but may be more prone to runtime type errors.
</code></pre>
<p>TypeScript is an example of adding static typing to a dynamically typed language (JavaScript).</p>
<h3 id="kotlin-modern-jvm-language">Kotlin: Modern JVM Language</h3>
<p>Kotlin is another language that runs on the JVM, often considered a modern alternative to Java.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also used for Android app development; favored for modern native Android apps.</li>
