</blockquote>
<h3 id="primer-on-deepseek-ai">Primer on DeepSeek AI</h3>
<p>Before diving into practical applications, let's understand what DeepSeek is and what they offer. DeepSeek is a Chinese company known for creating open-weight LLMs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Open-weight Models:</strong> AI models where the model weights (the parameters learned during training that define the model's behavior) are publicly available. This allows for greater transparency, customization, and community contribution compared to closed-source models.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="deepseeks-model-family">DeepSeek's Model Family:</h4>
<p>DeepSeek offers a range of open-weight models, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>R1 Series:</strong>  The primary focus of this crash course, particularly DeepSeek R1.</li>
<li><strong>R1.5:</strong> An enhanced version of R1.</li>
<li><strong>R10:</strong> An earlier model in the series, trained via reinforcement learning.</li>
<li><strong>DeepSeek V3:</strong> Utilized on the DeepSeek.com website, a more advanced model compared to R1.</li>
<li><strong>Math Coder:</strong> Specialized models for mathematical and coding tasks.</li>
<li><strong>MoE (Mixture of Experts) and MoM (Mixture of Models):</strong> Advanced model architectures that combine multiple sub-models for improved performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>While DeepSeek offers various models, this chapter will primarily concentrate on <strong>DeepSeek R1</strong> and initially explore <strong>DeepSeek V3</strong> as it is available on their website.</p>
<h4 id="deepseek-r1-key-features-and-significance">DeepSeek R1: Key Features and Significance</h4>
<p>DeepSeek R1 is built upon the foundation of <strong>DeepSeek R10</strong>, a model detailed in a research paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward. In the context of LLMs, it can be used to refine model behavior based on feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>DeepSeek R10</strong> was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning <em>without</em> supervised fine-tuning. It demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but suffered from issues like poor readability and language mixing.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSeek R1</strong> was subsequently trained to address these shortcomings, aiming for performance comparable to OpenAI's models. Benchmarks presented by DeepSeek suggest their models often outperform or match OpenAI in various text generation tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> DeepSeek R1 is primarily focused on text generation and does not inherently possess capabilities like image recognition or other modalities.</p>
<p>The primary significance of DeepSeek R1 lies in its <strong>cost-efficiency</strong>. It is speculated to offer a <strong>95-97% reduction in cost</strong> compared to OpenAI models.  This drastic reduction in training and operational costs is a major advantage, as training and running large models typically involve millions of dollars in compute resources. DeepSeek reportedly trained R1 for approximately $5 million, a fraction of the cost associated with similar models.</p>
<p>The emergence of cost-effective models like DeepSeek R1 has even impacted the stock market, with chip manufacturers experiencing stock drops as companies reconsider the necessity for expensive, high-compute hardware.</p>
<p>This crash course aims to explore DeepSeek R1, investigate its capabilities, and identify its limitations in local deployment scenarios.</p>

<p>LM Studio incorporates agentic behavior, providing more than just direct model output. It appears to add a layer of reasoning and thought processing to the interaction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thought Process Display:</strong> LM Studio can display the model's "thought process" as it generates responses, showing intermediate reasoning steps and considerations. This offers insights into the model's decision-making process.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Interaction:</strong> This agentic behavior makes the interaction feel more like engaging with an AI assistant capable of reasoning and planning, rather than just a direct model output playground.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware-performance-and-troubleshooting-with-lm-studio">Hardware Performance and Troubleshooting with LM Studio:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPU Offloading:</strong> LM Studio offers options to offload model layers to the GPU, improving inference speed if a compatible GPU is available.  Experiment with GPU offloading settings to optimize performance based on your hardware.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Context Length Adjustment:</strong>  LM Studio allows adjusting the context length, which can impact memory usage and performance. Reducing the context length might be necessary for resource-constrained systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Context Length:</strong> The amount of preceding text that a Large Language Model considers when generating the next token or response. A longer context length allows the model to understand and maintain context over longer conversations or documents, but also increases computational demands.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource Exhaustion and System Instability:</strong> Running LLMs, especially with agentic behavior, can be resource-intensive. On resource-constrained systems (like the Intel Lunar Lake AI PC), LM Studio might lead to system slowdowns, crashes, or reboots if models are too large or settings are not optimized.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Compatibility:</strong>  While LM Studio aims to support various hardware, compatibility and performance can vary. Experimentation and hardware-aware configuration are often necessary to achieve optimal results.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Optimization:</strong>  Optimizing LM Studio settings, such as GPU offloading, context length, and CPU thread allocation, can help improve performance and stability, especially on less powerful hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>LM Studio offers a significant step up from basic terminal interaction with LLMs. Its GUI, model catalog, chat interface, and agentic behavior features provide a more complete and user-friendly experience for exploring and experimenting with DeepSeek R1 and other local LLMs. However, hardware limitations and resource management remain important considerations for achieving smooth and stable performance, especially with larger models or on less powerful hardware.</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hugging Face API Token (Optional but Recommended):</strong> For accessing models from the Hugging Face Hub, you may need a Hugging Face API token. Create an account on <a href="https://huggingface.co">huggingface.co</a> and generate an API token under your profile settings. Set this token as an environment variable named <code>HF_TOKEN</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="loading-deepseek-r1-model-using-transformers">Loading DeepSeek R1 Model using Transformers:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model Identifier:</strong> Identify the Hugging Face model identifier for the DeepSeek R1 model you want to use. For example, "deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-llama-8b-instruct".</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipeline Approach (Simplified Inference):</strong> The Transformers library offers a <code>pipeline</code> function for simplified inference. This approach abstracts away some of the lower-level details.</p>
<p>```python
from transformers import pipeline</p>
<h1 id="initialize-the-pipeline-with-the-deepseek-r1-model-identifier">Initialize the pipeline with the DeepSeek R1 model identifier</h1>
<p>pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-llama-8b-instruct")</p>
<h1 id="generate-text-using-the-pipeline">Generate text using the pipeline</h1>
<p>prompt = "Write a short story about a robot learning to feel emotions."
output = pipe(prompt)</p>
<p>print(output[0]['generated_text'])
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Model and Tokenizer Loading (More Control):</strong> For more control, you can load the model and tokenizer separately.</p>
<p>```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer</p>
<h1 id="model-identifier">Model identifier</h1>
<p>model_name = "deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-llama-8b-instruct"</p>
<h1 id="load-tokenizer">Load tokenizer</h1>
<p>tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)</p>
<h1 id="load-model">Load model</h1>
<p>model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)</p>
<h1 id="prepare-input-for-the-model">Prepare input for the model</h1>
<p>prompt = "Translate 'Hello, world!' to French."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt") # pt for PyTorch tensors</p>
<h1 id="generate-output">Generate output</h1>
<p>outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
decoded_output = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)</p>
<p>print(decoded_output)
```</p>
