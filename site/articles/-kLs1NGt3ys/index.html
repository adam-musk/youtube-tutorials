<li><strong>Pull Changes Locally:</strong> In your terminal, run <code>git pull</code> to fetch the latest changes from GitHub to your local project.</li>
<li><strong>Modify <code>CardList</code> Component Code:</strong><ul>
<li>Open the <code>CardList</code> component file (likely in <code>src/components/CardList.jsx</code> or similar, depending on your project structure) in your code editor.</li>
<li>Import <code>useState</code> from React: <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';</code>.</li>
<li>In the <code>CardList</code> component function, add a <code>useState</code> hook to manage the "show more" state:
    <code>javascript
    const [showAll, setShowAll] = useState(false);</code></li>
<li>Modify the data mapping logic to conditionally render listings based on the <code>showAll</code> state. For example, use <code>Array.slice()</code> to initially display a limited number of listings and then display all listings when <code>showAll</code> is true.</li>
<li>Pass the <code>setShowAll</code> function as a prop to the "Show More" button component.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="deployment-overview">Deployment Overview</h2>
<p>To make your application accessible online, you need to deploy both the frontend and backend.</p>
<p><strong>Frontend Deployment (Netlify):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Netlify is a popular platform for deploying static frontend applications.</li>
<li>Connect your Netlify account to your GitHub repository containing your frontend code.</li>
<li>Configure Netlify to build and deploy your React application automatically whenever you push changes to your repository.</li>
<li>Netlify provides a free tier suitable for learning and small projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backend Deployment (Separate Server or Platform-as-a-Service):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backend deployment is more complex than frontend deployment. You need a server environment to run your Node.js backend.</li>
<li>Options include:<ul>
<li><strong>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers:</strong> Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, etc. These platforms simplify backend deployment and management.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Private Server (VPS):</strong> You can rent a VPS and manually configure and deploy your Node.js backend. This offers more control but requires server administration skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consult the documentation for your chosen deployment platform for detailed instructions on deploying a Node.js application.</li>
<li><strong>Netlify Documentation:</strong> While Netlify is primarily for frontends, it offers some backend functionalities (like serverless functions). However, for a full Node.js backend, you'll likely need a separate hosting solution. Review Netlify's documentation and support forums for guidance on backend deployment options that integrate well with Netlify-hosted frontends.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Netlify Documentation:</strong> Official documentation and guides provided by Netlify, a platform for deploying and hosting web applications. It contains information on features, configurations, and best practices for using Netlify services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Considerations for Deployment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environment Variables:</strong> Securely manage environment variables (especially your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret) in your deployment environment. Do not hardcode sensitive information directly in your code. Use platform-specific mechanisms for setting environment variables (e.g., Netlify environment variables, Heroku config vars).</li>
<li><strong>CORS Configuration:</strong> Ensure your backend is properly configured for CORS to allow requests from your deployed frontend domain.</li>
<li><strong>Database Security:</strong> Secure your MongoDB Atlas database by configuring network access rules and authentication properly.</li>
</ul>
